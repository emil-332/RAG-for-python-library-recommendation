      "text": "spacy-legacy: Legacy functions and architectures for backwards compatibility\n\nThis package includes outdated registered functions for [spaCy](https://spacy.io) v3.x, for example model architectures, pipeline components and utilities. It's **installed automatically** as a dependency of spaCy, and allows us to provide backwards compatibility, while keeping the core library tidy and up to date. All of this happens under the hood, so you typically shouldn't have to care about this package.\n\n(https://dev.azure.com/explosion-ai/public/_build?definitionId=21)\n(https://pypi.org/project/spacy-legacy/)\n\nHow it works\n\nWhenever a new backwards-incompatible version of a registered function is available, e.g. `spacy.Tok2Vec.v1` &rarr; `spacy.Tok2Vec.v2`, the legacy version is moved to `spacy-legacy`, and exposed via [entry points](setup.cfg). This means that it will still be available if your config files use it, even though the core library only includes the latest version.\n\nLegacy functions are exposed with the prefix `spacy-legacy`, e.g. `spacy-legacy.Tok2Vec.v1`. When spaCy resolves your config and a function is not available in the core library, e.g. `spacy.Tok2Vec.v1`, it will check if there's a legacy function available and fall back to that. You can also explicitly refer to legacy functions in your config, to indicate that a newer version is available.",
