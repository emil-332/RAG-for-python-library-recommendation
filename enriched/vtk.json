VTK includes many\nadvanced algorithms (e.g., surface reconstruction, implicit modeling,\ndecimation) and rendering techniques (e.g., hardware-accelerated\nvolume rendering, LOD control).\n\nVTK is used by academicians for teaching and research; by government\nresearch institutions such as Los Alamos National Lab in the US or\nCINECA in Italy; and by many commercial firms who use VTK to build or\nextend products.\n\nThe origin of VTK is with the textbook \"The Visualization Toolkit, an\nObject-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics\" originally published by\nPrentice Hall and now published by Kitware, Inc. (Third Edition ISBN\n1-930934-07-6). VTK has grown (since its initial release in 1994) to a\nworld-wide user base in the commercial, academic, and research\ncommunities.\n\nLearning Resources\n==================\n\n* General information is available at the [VTK Homepage][vtk-homepage].\n\n* Community discussion takes place on the [VTK Discourse][vtk-discourse] forum.\n\n* Commercial [support and training][kitware-support]\n  are available from [Kitware][].\n\n* Doxygen-generated nightly reference documentation is\n  available [online][vtk-doxygen].\n\n* There is now a large collection of [VTK Examples][vtk-examples] that\n  showcase VTK features and provide a useful learning resource.\n\nReporting Bugs\n==============\n\nIf you have found a bug:\n\n1. If you have a patch, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md][vtk-contributing] document.\n\n2. Otherwise, please join the [VTK Discourse][vtk-discourse] forum and ask\n   about the expected and observed behaviors to determine if it is\n   really a bug.\n\n3. Finally, if the issue is not resolved by the above steps, open\n   an entry in the [VTK Issue Tracker][vtk-issues].\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nIn general VTK tries to be as portable as possible; the specific configurations below are known to work and tested.\n\nVTK supports the following compilers:\n\n1. GCC 8.0 or newer\n2. Clang 5.0 or newer\n3. Apple Clang 10.0 or newer\n4. Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or newer\n5. Intel 19.0 or newer\n\nVTK supports the following operating systems:\n\n1. Windows Vista or newer\n2. Mac OS X 10.7 or newer\n3. Linux (ex: Ubuntu 12.04 or newer, Debian 4 or newer)\n\nBuilding\n========\n\nSee [build.md][vtk-build] (in Documentation/dev/) for build instructions.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md][vtk-contributing] for instructions to contribute.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nVTK is distributed under the OSI-approved BSD 3-clause License.\nSee [Copyright.txt][vtk-copyright] for details.",
