It is widely used in the scientific community and is written by scientists for scientists. \n\nIt works with a wide range of popular simulation packages including GROMACS, Amber, NAMD, CHARMM, DL_POLY, HOOMD, LAMMPS and many others — see the lists of supported `trajectory formats`_ and `topology formats`_.\nMDAnalysis also includes widely used analysis algorithms in the `MDAnalysis.analysis`_ module.\n\n.. _numfocus-fiscal-sponsor-attribution:\n\nThe MDAnalysis project uses an `open governance model`_ and is fiscally sponsored by `NumFOCUS`_. Consider making \na `tax-deductible donation`_ to help the project pay for developer time, professional services, travel, workshops, and a variety of other needs.\n\n.. image:: https://www.mdanalysis.org/public/images/numfocus-sponsored-small.png\n   :alt: NumFOCUS (Fiscally Sponsored Project)\n   :target: https://numfocus.org/project/mdanalysis\n   :align: center\n\nThis project is bound by a `Code of Conduct`_.\n\npowered_by_MDA\n\nExample analysis script\n=======================\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   import MDAnalysis as mda\n\n   # Load simulation results with a single line\n   u = mda.Universe('topol.tpr','traj.trr')\n\n   # Select atoms\n   ag = u.select_atoms('name OH')\n\n   # Atom data made available as Numpy arrays\n   ag.positions\n   ag.velocities\n   ag.forces\n\n   # Iterate through trajectories\n   for ts in u.trajectory:\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\n**New users** should read the `Quickstart Guide`_ and might want to\nlook at our videos_, in which core developers explain various aspects\nof MDAnalysis.\n\n**All users** should read the `User Guide`_.\n\n**Developers** may also want to refer to the `MDAnalysis API docs`_.\n\nA growing number of `tutorials`_ are available that explain how to\nconduct RMSD calculations, structural alignment, distance and contact\nanalysis, and many more.\n\nInstallation and availability\n=============================\n\nThe latest release can be **installed via pip or conda** as\ndescribed in the `Installation Quick Start`_.\n\n**Source code** is hosted in a git repository at\nGNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or any later version (LGPLv3+).\nIndividual source code components are provided under the\nGNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or any later version (LGPLv2.1+).\nPlease see the file LICENSE_ for more information.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nPlease report **bugs** or **enhancement requests** through the `Issue\nTracker`_.
