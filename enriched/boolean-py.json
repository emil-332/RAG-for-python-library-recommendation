  "usage_description": "Here is a short summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to define and work with boolean expressions in a programmatically accessible way, allowing for parsing, simplification, and comparison of complex boolean statements. With boolean-py, developers can also create custom boolean DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) and algebraic structures tailored to their specific needs."
