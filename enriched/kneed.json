Given a set of `x` and `y` values, `kneed` will return the knee point of the function. The knee point is the point of maximum curvature.\n\nTable of contents\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  - [Input Data](#input-data)\n  - [Find Knee](#find-knee)\n  - [Visualize](#visualize)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Interactive](#interactive)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Citation](#citation)\n\nInstallation  \n`kneed` has been tested with Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.\n\n**anaconda**\n\n**pip**\n\n**Clone from GitHub**\n\nUsage\nThese steps introduce how to use `kneed` by reproducing Figure 2 from the manuscript.\n\nInput Data\nThe `DataGenerator` class is only included as a utility to generate sample datasets. \n>  Note: `x` and `y` must be equal length arrays.\n\nFind Knee  \nThe knee (or elbow) point is calculated simply by instantiating the `KneeLocator` class with `x`, `y` and the appropriate `curve` and `direction`.  \nHere, `kneedle.knee` and/or `kneedle.elbow` store the point of maximum curvature.\n\nThe knee point returned is a value along the `x` axis. The `y` value at the knee can be identified:\n\nVisualize\nThe `KneeLocator` class also has two plotting functions for quick visualizations.\n**Note that all (x, y) are transformed for the normalized plots**\n\nDocumentation\nDocumentation of the parameters and a full API reference can be found [here](https://kneed.readthedocs.io/).\n\nInteractive\nAn interactive streamlit app was developed to help users explore the effect of tuning the parameters.\nThere are two sites where you can test out kneed by copy-pasting your own data:\n1. https://share.streamlit.io/arvkevi/ikneed/main/ikneed.py\n2. https://ikneed.herokuapp.com/\n\nYou can also run your own version -- head over to the [source code for ikneed](https://github.com/arvkevi/ikneed).\n\nContributing\n\nContributions are welcome, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/arvkevi/kneed/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) \nto learn more about how to contribute.\n\nCitation\n\nFinding a “Kneedle” in a Haystack:\nDetecting Knee Points in System Behavior\nVille Satopa\n†\n, Jeannie Albrecht†\n, David Irwin‡\n, and Barath Raghavan§\n†Williams College, Williamstown, MA\n‡University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA\n§\nInternational Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, CA",
