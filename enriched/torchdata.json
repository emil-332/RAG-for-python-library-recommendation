We do not plan on\ncontinuing development or maintaining the [`DataPipes`] and [`DataLoaderV2`] solutions, and they will be removed from\nthe torchdata repo. We'll also be revisiting the `DataPipes` references in pytorch/pytorch. In release\n`torchdata==0.8.0` (July 2024) they will be marked as deprecated, and sometime after 0.9.0 (Oct 2024) they will be\ndeleted. Existing users are advised to pin to `torchdata==0.9.0` or an older version until they are able to migrate\naway. Subsequent releases will not include DataPipes or DataLoaderV2. The old version of this README is\n[available here](https://github.com/pytorch/data/blob/v0.7.1/README.md). Please reach out if you suggestions or comments\n(please use [#1196](https://github.com/pytorch/data/issues/1196) for feedback).**\n\n## What is TorchData?\n\nThe TorchData project is an iterative enhancement to the PyTorch torch.utils.data.DataLoader and\ntorch.utils.data.Dataset/IterableDataset to make them scalable, performant dataloading solutions. We will be iterating\non the enhancements under [the torchdata repo](torchdata).\n\nOur first change begins with adding checkpointing to torch.utils.data.DataLoader, which can be found in\n[stateful_dataloader, a drop-in replacement for torch.utils.data.DataLoader](torchdata/stateful_dataloader), by defining\n`load_state_dict` and `state_dict` methods that enable mid-epoch checkpointing, and an API for users to track custom\niteration progress, and other custom states from the dataloader workers such as token buffers and/or RNG states.\n\nStateful DataLoader\n\n`torchdata.stateful_dataloader.StatefulDataLoader` is a drop-in replacement for torch.utils.data.DataLoader which\nprovides state_dict and load_state_dict functionality. See\n[the Stateful DataLoader main page](torchdata/stateful_dataloader) for more information and examples. Also check out the\nexamples\n[in this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tonoovEd7Tsi8EW8ZHXf0v3yHJGwZP8M?usp=sharing).\n\ntorchdata.nodes\n\ntorchdata.nodes is a library of composable iterators (not iterables!) that let you chain together common dataloading and\npre-proc operations. It follows a streaming programming model, although \"sampler + Map-style\" can still be configured if\nyou desire. See [torchdata.nodes main page](torchdata/nodes) for more details. Stay tuned for tutorial on\ntorchdata.nodes coming soon!\n\nInstallation\n\nVersion Compatibility\n\nThe following is the corresponding `torchdata` versions and supported Python versions.\n\n`torch`\n--------------------\n`master` / `nightly`\n\nLocal pip or conda\n\nFirst, set up an environment. We will be installing a PyTorch binary as well as torchdata. If you're using conda, create\na conda environment:\n\nIf you wish to use `venv` instead:\n\nInstall torchdata:\n\nUsing pip:\n\nUsing conda:\n\nFrom source\n\nIn case building TorchData from source fails, install the nightly version of PyTorch following the linked guide on the\n[contributing page](CONTRIBUTING.md#install-pytorch-nightly).\n\nFrom nightly\n\nThe nightly version of TorchData is also provided and updated daily from main branch.\n\nUsing pip:\n\nUsing conda:\n\nContributing\n\nWe welcome PRs! See the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\nBeta Usage and Feedback\n\nWe'd love to hear from and work with early adopters to shape our designs. Please reach out by raising an issue if you're\ninterested in using this tooling for your project.\n\nLicense\n\nTorchData is BSD licensed, as found in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.",
