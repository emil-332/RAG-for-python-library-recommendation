      "text": "Package Description\n-------------------\nThis package provides encoding and decoding routines that enable the\nserialization and deserialization of numerical and array data types provided by \n[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) using the highly efficient\n[msgpack](http://msgpack.org/) format. Serialization of Python's\nnative complex data types is also supported.\n\n(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msgpack-numpy)\n(https://travis-ci.org/lebedov/msgpack-numpy)\n\nInstallation\n------------\nmsgpack-numpy requires msgpack-python and numpy. If you \nhave [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) installed on your\nsystem, run\n\nto install the package and all dependencies. You can also download \nthe source tarball, unpack it, and run\n\nfrom within the source directory.\n\nUsage\n-----\nThe easiest way to use msgpack-numpy is to call its monkey patching\nfunction after importing the Python msgpack package:\n\nThis will automatically force all msgpack serialization and deserialization\nroutines (and other packages that use them) to become numpy-aware. \nOf course, one can also manually pass the encoder and \ndecoder provided by msgpack-numpy to the msgpack routines:\n\nmsgpack-numpy will try to use the binary (fast) extension in msgpack by default.  \nIf msgpack was not compiled with Cython (or if the ``MSGPACK_PUREPYTHON`` \nvariable is set), it will fall back to using the slower pure Python msgpack \nimplementation.\n\nNotes\n-----\nThe primary design goal of msgpack-numpy is ensuring preservation of numerical\ndata types during msgpack serialization and deserialization. Inclusion of type\ninformation in the serialized data necessarily incurs some storage overhead; if\npreservation of type information is not needed, one may be able to avoid some\nof this overhead by writing a custom encoder/decoder pair that produces more\nefficient serializations for those specific use cases. \n\nNumpy arrays with a dtype of 'O' are serialized/deserialized using pickle as \na fallback solution to enable msgpack-numpy to handle\nsuch arrays. As the additional overhead of pickle serialization negates one\nof the reasons to use msgpack, it may be advisable to either write a custom\nencoder/decoder to handle the specific use case efficiently or else not bother\nusing msgpack-numpy.\n\nNote that numpy arrays deserialized by msgpack-numpy are read-only and must be copied \nif they are to be modified.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\nThe latest source code can be obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/lebedov/msgpack-numpy/).\n\nmsgpack-numpy maintains compatibility with python versions 2.7 and 3.5+.\n\nInstall [`tox`](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to support testing\nacross multiple python versions in your development environment. If you\nuse [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install `python` use\n[`tox-conda`](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-conda) to automatically manage\ntesting across all supported python versions.\n\nExecute tests across supported python versions:\n\nAuthors\n-------\nSee the included [AUTHORS.md](https://github.com/lebedov/msgpack-numpy/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) file for \nmore information.\n\nLicense\n-------\nThis software is licensed under the [BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license).\nSee the included [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/lebedov/msgpack-numpy/blob/master/LICENSE.md) file for \nmore information.",
