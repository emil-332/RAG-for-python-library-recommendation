      "text": "Polars: Extremely fast Query Engine for DataFrames, written in Rust\n\nPolars is an analytical query engine written for DataFrames. It is designed to be fast, easy to use\nand expressive. Key features are:\n\n- Lazy | Eager execution\n- Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)\n- Query optimization\n- Multi-threaded\n- Written in Rust\n- SIMD\n- Powerful expression API\n- Front end in Python | Rust | NodeJS | R | SQL\n- [Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)\n\nTo learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).\n\nPerformance\n\nBlazingly fast\n\nPolars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the\n[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.\n\nLightweight\n\nPolars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the\nimport times:\n\n- polars: 70ms\n- numpy: 104ms\n- pandas: 520ms\n\nHandles larger-than-RAM data\n\nIf you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars' query engine is able to process your query\n(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so\nyou might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with\n`collect(engine='streaming')` to run the query streaming.\n\nSetup\n\nPython\n\nInstall the latest Polars version with:\n\nSee the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details\non optional dependencies\n\nTo see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:\n\nContributing\n\nWant to contribute? Read our [contributing guide](https://docs.pola.rs/development/contributing/).\n\nManaged/Distributed Polars\n\nDo you want a managed solution or scale out to distributed clusters? Consider our\n[offering](https://cloud.pola.rs/) and help the project!\n\nPython: compile Polars from source\n\nIf you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.\n\nThis can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:\n\n1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`\n3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:\n   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times\n   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile\n   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly\n   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower\n   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times\n\nBy default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`\nwith the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.\n\nNote that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from\nthe wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are\nnamed `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.\n\nUsing custom Rust functions in Python\n\nExtending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and\n`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/pyo3-polars.\n\nGoing big...\n\nDo you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,\nfor Python users, install `pip install polars[rt64]`.\n\nDon't use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes\nless memory.\n\nLegacy\n\nDo you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of\nPython on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars[rtcompat]`. This version of\nPolars is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target\nfeatures.",

  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to efficiently process and analyze large datasets, providing blazingly fast performance through lazy or eager execution and query optimization features. With Polars, developers can write powerful analytical queries in their language of choice (Python, Rust, NodeJS, R, SQL), leveraging the benefits of SIMD, multi-threading, and columnar storage formats for high-performance data processing."
