We document the math behind\nsome of the algorithms using `sympy `_ in\n``transforms3d/derivations``.  We would be very pleased if y'all would like to\nadd your own algorithms and derivations - please get a copy of the code from\nalgorithmically.  Feel free to use the github issue tracker and pull request\nsystem to ask for advice and support.\n\n*************\nDocumentation\n*************\n\nDocumentation for latest released version at\n\n****\nCode\n****\n\nSee https://github.com/matthew-brett/transforms3d\n\nReleased under the BSD two-clause license - see the file ``LICENSE`` in the\nsource distribution.\n\nMuch of the code comes from `transformations.py\n`_ by Christoph\nGohlke, also released under the BSD license.\n\nWe use Github actions to test the code automatically under Pythons 3.7 through\n3.10.\n\nWe depend on numpy >= 1.15.
