We changed the major version number to \nsignify the breaking changes in the API. To install the previous version of `gprofiler-official`, use the command\n\nTools:\n\nTo use any of the tools in the g:Profiler toolkit, first initialize the GProfiler object.\n\ng:GOSt (profile)\n\nOutput:\n\n* `source` is the code for the datasource\n* `native` is the ID for the enriched term/functional category in its native namespace.\n* `name` is the readable name for the enriched term, `description` is the longer description if available.\n* `p_value` is the corrected p-value for the \n* `term_size`, `query_size`, `intersection_size`, `effective_domain_size` are parameters to the hypergeometric test.\n* `query` is the name of the query and is significant if multiple queries were made in one call (e.g `gp.profile(query={'query1':['NR1H4'], 'query2':['NR1H4','TRIP12']})`)\n\nSetting the parameter `no_evidences=False` would add the column `intersections` (a list of genes that are annotated to the term and are present in the query )\nand the column `evidences` (a list of lists of GO evidence codes for the intersecting genes)\n\nNB! the parameter `combined` significantly changes the output structure by packing the results of distinct queries together.\nFor example:\n\nOutput (truncated):\n\ng:Convert (convert)\n\nOutput:\n\n`incoming` column lists the input gene, `converted` lists the gene in the target namespace (Entrez Gene accession number in this case).\n\ng:Orth (orth)\n\nOutput:\n\n`incoming` is the input gene, `converted` is the canonical Ensembl ID for the input gene, \n`ortholog_ensg` is the canonical Ensembl ID for the orthologous gene in the target organism.\n\ng:SNPense (snpense)\n\nOutput:\n\n* `rs_id` is the input rs-number\n* `chromosome`, `strand`, `start` and `end` encode the position of the variation\n* `ensgs` and `gene_names` are lists of protein-encoding genes associated with the rs-number.\n* `variants` are predicted variant effects.",
