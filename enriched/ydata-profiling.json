Show us your love and give feedback!\n\n`ydata-profiling` primary goal is to provide a one-line Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) experience in a consistent and fast solution. Like pandas `df.describe()` function, that is so handy, ydata-profiling delivers an extended analysis of a DataFrame while allowing the data analysis to be exported in different formats such as **html** and **json**.\n\nThe package outputs a simple and digested analysis of a dataset, including **time-series** and **text**.\n\n> **Looking for a scalable solution that can fully integrate with your database systems?**\n> Leverage YData Fabric Data Catalog to connect to different databases and storages (Oracle, snowflake, PostGreSQL, GCS, S3, etc.) and leverage an interactive and guided profiling experience in Fabric. Check out the [Community Version](http://ydata.ai/register?utm_source=ydata-profiling&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=YData%20Fabric%20Community).\n\n▶️ Quickstart\n\nInstall\n\nor\n\nStart profiling\n\nStart by loading your pandas `DataFrame` as you normally would, e.g. by using:\n\nTo generate the standard profiling report, merely run:\n\nKey features\n\n- **Type inference**: automatic detection of columns' data types (*Categorical*, *Numerical*, *Date*, etc.)\n- **Warnings**: A summary of the problems/challenges in the data that you might need to work on (*missing data*, *inaccuracies*, *skewness*, etc.)\n- **Univariate analysis**: including descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc) and informative visualizations such as distribution histograms\n- **Multivariate analysis**: including correlations, a detailed analysis of missing data, duplicate rows, and visual support for variables pairwise interaction\n- **Time-Series**: including different statistical information relative to time dependent data such as auto-correlation and seasonality, along ACF and PACF plots.\n- **Text analysis**: most common categories (uppercase, lowercase, separator), scripts (Latin, Cyrillic) and blocks (ASCII, Cyrilic)\n- **File and Image analysis**: file sizes, creation dates, dimensions, indication of truncated images and existence of EXIF metadata\n- **Compare datasets**: one-line solution to enable a fast and complete report on the comparison of datasets\n- **Flexible output formats**: all analysis can be exported to an HTML report that can be easily shared with different parties, as JSON for an easy integration in automated systems and as a widget in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\nThe report contains three additional sections:\n\n- **Overview**: mostly global details about the dataset (number of records, number of variables, overall missigness and duplicates, memory footprint)\n- **Alerts**: a comprehensive and automatic list of potential data quality issues (high correlation, skewness, uniformity, zeros, missing values, constant values, between others)\n- **Reproduction**: technical details about the analysis (time, version and configuration)\n\nLatest features\n\nSpark\n\nSpark support has been released, but we are always looking for an extra pair of hands .\n[Check current work in progress!](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling/projects/3).\n\nUse cases\nYData-profiling can be used to deliver a variety of different use-case. The documentation includes guides, tips and tricks for tackling them:\n\nUse case\n----------\n[Comparing datasets](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/comparing_datasets)\n[Profiling a Time-Series dataset](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/time_series_datasets)\n[Profiling large datasets](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/big_data)\n[Handling sensitive data](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/sensitive_data)\n[Dataset metadata and data dictionaries](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/metadata)\n[Customizing the report's appearance](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/custom_reports)\n[Profiling Databases](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/collaborative_data_profiling)\n\nUsing inside Jupyter Notebooks",

      "text": "There are two interfaces to consume the report inside a Jupyter notebook: through widgets and through an embedded HTML report.\n\nThe above is achieved by simply displaying the report as a set of widgets. In a Jupyter Notebook, run:\n\nThe HTML report can be directly embedded in a cell in a similar fashion:\n\nExporting the report to a file\n\nTo generate a HTML report file, save the `ProfileReport` to an object and use the `to_file()` function:\n\nAlternatively, the report's data can be obtained as a JSON file:\n\nUsing in the command line\n\nFor standard formatted CSV files (which can be read directly by pandas without additional settings), the `ydata_profiling` executable can be used in the command line. The example below generates a report named *Example Profiling Report*, using a configuration file called `default.yaml`, in the file `report.html` by processing a `data.csv` dataset.\n\nAdditional details on the CLI are available [on the documentation](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/pages/getting_started/quickstart.html#command-line-usage).\n\nExamples\n\nThe following example reports showcase the potentialities of the package across a wide range of dataset and data types:\n\n* [Census Income](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/census/census_report.html) (US Adult Census data relating income with other demographic properties)\n* [NASA Meteorites](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/meteorites/meteorites_report.html) (comprehensive set of meteorite landing - object properties and locations) (https://colab.research.google.com/github/ydataai/pandas-profiling/blob/master/examples/meteorites/meteorites_cloud.ipynb) (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ydataai/pandas-profiling/master?filepath=examples%2Fmeteorites%2Fmeteorites%5Fcloud.ipynb)\n* [Titanic](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/titanic/titanic_report.html) (the \"Wonderwall\" of datasets) (https://colab.research.google.com/github/ydataai/pandas-profiling/blob/master/examples/titanic/titanic_cloud.ipynb) (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ydataai/pandas-profiling/master?filepath=examples%2Ftitanic%2Ftitanic%5Fcloud.ipynb)\n* [NZA](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/nza/nza_report.html) (open data from the Dutch Healthcare Authority)\n* [Stata Auto](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/stata_auto/stata_auto_report.html) (1978 Automobile data)\n* [Colors](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/colors/colors_report.html) (a simple colors dataset)\n* [Vektis](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/vektis/vektis_report.html) (Vektis Dutch Healthcare data)\n* [UCI Bank Dataset](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/bank_marketing_data/uci_bank_marketing_report.html) (marketing dataset from a bank)\n* [Russian Vocabulary](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/features/russian_vocabulary.html) (100 most common Russian words, showcasing unicode text analysis)\n* [Website Inaccessibility](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/features/website_inaccessibility_report.html) (website accessibility analysis, showcasing support for URL data)\n* [Orange prices](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/features/united_report.html) and \n* [Coal prices](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/examples/master/features/flatly_report.html) (simple pricing evolution datasets, showcasing the theming options)\n* [USA Air Quality](https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling/tree/master/examples/usaairquality) (Time-series air quality dataset EDA example)\n* [HCC](https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling/tree/master/examples/hcc) (Open dataset from healthcare, showcasing compare between two sets of data, before and after preprocessing)\n\n️ Installation\nAdditional details, including information about widget support, are available [on the documentation](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/pages/getting_started/installation.html).\n\nUsing pip\n(https://pepy.tech/project/ydata-profiling)\n(https://pepy.tech/project/ydata-profiling/month)\n(https://pypi.org/project/ydata-profiling/)\n\nYou can install using the `pip` package manager by running:\n\nExtras\n\nThe package declares \"extras\", sets of additional dependencies.\n\n* `[notebook]`: support for rendering the report in Jupyter notebook widgets.\n* `[unicode]`: support for more detailed Unicode analysis, at the expense of additional disk space.\n* `[pyspark]`: support for pyspark for big dataset analysis\n\nInstall these with e.g.\n\nUsing conda\n(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pandas-profiling)\n(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pandas-profiling)\n\nYou can install using the `conda` package manager by running:\n\nFrom source (development)\n\nDownload the source code by cloning the repository or click on [Download ZIP](https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling/archive/master.zip) to download the latest stable version.\n\nInstall it by navigating to the proper directory and running:\n\nThe profiling report is written in HTML and CSS, which means a modern browser is required.\n\nYou need [Python 3](https://python3statement.github.io/) to run the package.
