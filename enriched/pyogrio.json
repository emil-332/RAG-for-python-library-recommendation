      "text": "pyogrio - bulk-oriented spatial vector file I/O using GDAL/OGR\n\nPyogrio provides fast, bulk-oriented read and write access to \n[GDAL/OGR](https://gdal.org/en/latest/drivers/vector/index.html) vector data\nsources, such as ESRI Shapefile, GeoPackage, GeoJSON, and several others.\nVector data sources typically have geometries, such as points, lines, or\npolygons, and associated records with potentially many columns worth of data.\n\nThe typical use is to read or write these data sources to/from\n[GeoPandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas) `GeoDataFrames`. Because\nthe geometry column is optional, reading or writing only non-spatial data is\nalso possible. Hence, GeoPackage attribute tables, DBF files, or CSV files are\nalso supported.\n\nPyogrio is fast because it uses pre-compiled bindings for GDAL/OGR to read and\nwrite the data records in bulk. This approach avoids multiple steps of\nconverting to and from Python data types within Python, so performance becomes\nprimarily limited by the underlying I/O speed of data source drivers in\nGDAL/OGR.\n\nWe have seen \\>5-10x speedups reading files and \\>5-20x speedups writing files\ncompared to using row-per-row approaches (e.g. Fiona).\n\nRead the documentation for more information:\n[https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nRequirements\n\nSupports Python 3.10 - 3.14 and GDAL 3.6.x - 3.11.x.\n\nReading to GeoDataFrames requires `geopandas>=0.12` with `shapely>=2`.\n\nAdditionally, installing `pyarrow` in combination with GDAL 3.6+ enables\na further speed-up when specifying `use_arrow=True`.\n\nInstallation\n\nPyogrio is currently available on\n[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyogrio)\nand [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyogrio/)\nfor Linux, MacOS, and Windows.\n\nPlease read the\n[installation documentation](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)\nfor more information.\n\nSupported vector formats\n\nPyogrio supports most common vector data source formats (provided they are also\nsupported by GDAL/OGR), including ESRI Shapefile, GeoPackage, GeoJSON, and\nFlatGeobuf.\n\nPlease see the [list of supported formats](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_formats.html)\nfor more information.\n\nGetting started\n\nPlease read the [introduction](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_formats.html)\nfor more information and examples to get started using Pyogrio.\n\nYou can also check out the [API documentation](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)\nfor full details on using the API.\n\nCredits\n\nThis project is made possible by the tremendous efforts of the GDAL, Fiona, and\nGeopandas communities.",
