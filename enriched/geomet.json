This uses a custom extension\nto the GeoJSON standard in order to preserve SRID information through conversions.\nFor example:\n\nGeoPackage binary supports encoding of SRID and envelope information. If your geopackage\nhas an envelope specified, then it will be added into the resulting GeoJSON in a key \ncalled `'bbox'`:\n\nIn the same way, if a 'bbox' key is present on a `dumps`-ed geometry, it will be added to the \nheader of the GeoPackage geometry:\n\nIf an integer SRID identifier is present in a `'meta'` key (like `'meta': {'srid': 4326}`), then the SRID will be included in the\nGeoPackage header.\n\nHistory\n\nThis library was originally created as the result of a bug report related\nto another project: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openquake-old/+bug/1073909.\nThe source of this issue was largely due to a dependency on\n[GEOS](https://libgeos.org/), which is written in C/C++. Depending on GEOS\nrequires any data conversion bug fixes to happen upstream, which takes time\nand effort. Ultimately, this was the inspiration to create a more\nlightweight, pure-Python conversion library as an alterntive tool for\nreliably converting data between various geospatial formats.\n\nThe name \"GeoMet\" was inspired by \"met\", the German word for\n[mead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead). It is also a shortened version of\nthe word \"geometry\".\n\nLimitations\n\nOutputing \"empty\" geometries to binary formats is not supported\n\nAttempting to output an empty geometry to a binary format will result in an exception: `ValueError: Empty geometries cannot be represented in WKB. Reason: The dimensionality of the WKB would be ambiguous.` There are a few reasons for this this limitation:\n\nAs a result, GeoMet has chosen to not attempt to address these problems, and\nsimply raise an exception instead.\n\nExample:\n\nSee also",

  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to easily convert between various geospatial data formats, such as GeoJSON, WKT, and GeoPackage Binary, allowing for seamless integration of different spatial data sources. With Geomet, developers can quickly and reliably translate their geometric data into the desired format using its intuitive load/dump interfaces."
