It provides a unified interface for multiple time series learning tasks. Currently, this includes forecasting, time series classification, clustering, anomaly/changepoint detection, and other tasks. It comes with [time series algorithms](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/estimator_overview.html) and [scikit-learn] compatible tools to build, tune, and validate time series models.\n\n**[Documentation](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/users.html)** · **[Tutorials](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/examples.html)** · **[Release Notes](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/changelog.html)**\n---\n**Open&#160;Source**\n**Tutorials**\n**Community**\n\n**Code**\n**Downloads**\n**Citation**\n\n:books: Documentation\n\nDocumentation\n--------------------------------------\n:star: **[Tutorials]**\n:clipboard: **[Binder Notebooks]**\n:woman_technologist: **[Examples]**\n:scissors: **[Extension Templates]**\n:control_knobs: **[API Reference]**\n:tv: **[Video Tutorial]**\n:hammer_and_wrench: **[Changelog]**\n:deciduous_tree: **[Roadmap]**\n:pencil: **[Related Software]**\n\n:speech_balloon: Where to ask questions\n\nQuestions and feedback are extremely welcome!
