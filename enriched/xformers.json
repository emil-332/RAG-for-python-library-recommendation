  "usage_description": "This library is used to compose various building blocks for creating different architectures within the Transformer family, enabling developers to easily combine or modify these components. With xformers, developers can quickly reproduce state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the Transformer family by selecting and combining compatible building blocks."
