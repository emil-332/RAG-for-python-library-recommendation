      "text": "About\n=====\n\nPyclipper is a Cython wrapper exposing public functions and classes of\nthe C++ translation of the `Angus Johnson's Clipper library (ver.\n6.4.2) `__.\n\nSource code is available on\n`GitHub `__. The package is published on \n`PyPI `__.\n\nAbout Clipper\n-------------\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nFrom PyPI\n---------\n\n::\n\nFrom source\n-----------\n\nClone the repository:\n\n::\n\nInstall:\n\n::\n\nFor development, use an editable install:\n\n::\n\nClippers' preprocessor directives\n---------------------------------\nClipper can be compiled with the following preprocessor directives: ``use_int32``, ``use_xyz``, ``use_lines`` and ``use_deprecated``. \nAmong these the ``use_int32`` and ``use_lines`` can be used with Pyclipper.\n\n-  ``use_int32`` - when enabled 32bit ints are used instead of 64bit ints. This improve performance but coordinate values are limited to the range +/- 46340. In Pyclipper this directive is **disabled** by default.\n\n-  ``use_lines`` - enables line clipping. Adds a very minor cost to performance. In Pyclipper this directive is **enabled** by default (since version 0.9.2b0).\n\nIn case you would want to change these settings, clone this repository and change the ``define_macros`` collection (``setup.py``, pyclipper extension definition). Add a set like ``('use_int32', 1)`` to enable the directive, or remove the set to disable it. After that you need to rebuild the package.\n\nHow to use\n==========\n\nThis wrapper library tries to follow naming conventions of the original\nlibrary.\n\n-  ``ClipperLib`` namespace is represented by the ``pyclipper`` module,\n-  classes ``Clipper`` and ``ClipperOffset`` -> \n   ``Pyclipper`` and ``PyclipperOffset``,\n-  when Clipper is overloading functions with different number of\n   parameters or different types (eg. ``Clipper.Execute``, one function\n   fills a list of paths the other PolyTree) that becomes\n   ``Pyclipper.Execute`` and ``Pyclipper.Execute2``.\n\nBasic clipping example (based on `Angus Johnson's Clipper\nlibrary `__):\n\n.. code:: python\n\nBasic offset example:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nThe Clipper library uses integers instead of floating point values to\npreserve numerical robustness. If you need to scale coordinates of your polygons, this library provides helper functions ``scale_to_clipper()`` and ``scale_from_clipper()`` to achieve that. \n\nMigrating from Pyclipper ``0.9.3b0``\n------------------------------------\n\nIn previous version of Pyclipper (``0.9.3b0``) polygons could be automatically scaled using the ``SCALING_FACTOR`` variable. This was removed in version ``1.0.0`` due to inexact conversions related to floating point operations. This way the library now provides the original numerical robustness of the base library.\n\nThe ``SCALING_FACTOR`` removal **breaks backward compatibility**. \nFor an explanation and help with migration, see https://github.com/fonttools/pyclipper/wiki/Deprecating-SCALING_FACTOR.\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\n-  The Clipper library is written by `Angus\n   Johnson `__,\n-  This wrapper was initially written by `Maxime\n   Chalton `__,\n-  Adaptions to make it work with version 5 written by `Lukas\n   Treyer `__,\n-  Adaptions to make it work with version 6.2.1 and PyPI package written by `Gregor Ratajc `__,\n-  ``SCALING_FACTOR`` removal and additions to documentation by Michael Schwarz (@Feuermurmel),\n-  Bug fix `sympy.Zero` is not a collection by Jamie Bull (@jamiebull1),\n-  Travis CI and Appveyor CI integration for continuous builds of wheel packages by Cosimo Lupo (@anthrotype).\n\nThe package is maintained by Cosimo Lupo (`@anthrotype `__).\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n-  Pyclipper is available under `MIT\n   license `__.\n-  The core Clipper library is available under `Boost Software\n   License `__. Freeware for both\n   open source and commercial applications.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nFor recent versions, see the `GitHub Releases page `__.\n\n1.1.0\n-------\n\n- Updated embedded Clipper library to version 6.4.2.\n\n1.0.6\n-------\n-  Added support for Python 3.6.\n\n1.0.3\n-------\n-  added Travis CI and Appveyor CI to build wheel packages (thanks to @anthrotype)\n\n1.0.2\n-------\n-  bug fix: `sympy.Zero` recognized as a collection (thanks to @jamiebull1)\n\n1.0.0\n-------\n- **(breaks backwards compatibility)** removes SCALING_FACTOR (thanks to @Feuermurmel)\n\n0.9.3b0\n-------\n-  Applied SCALING_FACTOR to the relevant function parameters and class properties\n-  Refactored tests\n\n0.9.2b1\n-------\n-  bug fix: Fix setting of the PyPolyNode.IsHole property\n\n0.9.2b0\n-------\n-  enable preprocessor directive ``use_lines`` by default,\n-  bug fix: PyPolyNode.Contour that is now one path and not a list of paths as it was previously.",
