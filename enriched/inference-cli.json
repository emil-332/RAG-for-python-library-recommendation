Inference supports object detection, classification, and instance segmentation models, and running foundation models (CLIP and SAM).\n\n‍ Examples\n\ninference server start\n\nStarts a local inference server. It optionally takes a port number (default is 9001) and will only start the docker container if there is not already a container running on that port.\n\nBefore you begin, ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine. Docker provides a containerized environment, \nallowing the Roboflow Inference Server to run in a consistent and isolated manner, regardless of the host system. If \nyou haven't installed Docker yet, you can get it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).\n\nThe CLI will automatically detect the device you are running on and pull the appropriate Docker image.\n\nParameter `--env-file` (or `-e`) is the optional path for .env file that will be loaded into inference server \nin case that values of internal parameters needs to be adjusted. Any value passed explicitly as command parameter\nis considered as more important and will shadow the value defined in `.env` file under the same target variable name.\n\ninference server status\n\nChecks the status of the local inference server.\n\ninference server stop\n\nStops the inference server.\n\ninference infer\n\nRuns inference on a single image. It takes a path to an image, a Roboflow project name, model version, and API key, and will return a JSON object with the model's predictions. You can also specify a host to run inference on our hosted inference server.\n\nLocal image\n\nHosted image\n\nHosted API inference\n\nSupported Devices\n\nRoboflow Inference CLI currently supports the following device targets:\n\n- x86 CPU\n- ARM64 CPU\n- NVIDIA GPU\n\nFor Jetson specific inference server images, check out the [Roboflow Inference](https://pypi.org/project/inference/) package, or pull the images directly following instructions in the official [Roboflow Inference documentation](https://inference.roboflow.com/quickstart/docker/#pull-from-docker-hub).\n\nlicense\n\nThe Roboflow Inference code is distributed under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/roboflow/inference/blob/master/LICENSE.core). The models supported by Roboflow Inference have their own licenses.

  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to deploy computer vision models to various devices and environments using Roboflow's Inference CLI. Developers can leverage this library to run object detection, classification, instance segmentation, and foundation models (such as CLIP and SAM) locally or through the Roboflow Hosted API with minimal setup and configuration required."
