This module is designed to facilitate some of the low level\noperating system interactions that are useful when exploring a filesystem\non a remote host, where queries such as *\"what is the root of the filesystem?\"*,\n*\"what is the user's name?\"*, and *\"what login shell is preferred?\"* become\nessential in allowing a remote user to function as if they were logged in\nlocally. While ``pox`` is in the same vein of both the ``os`` and ``shutil``\nbuiltin modules, the majority of its functionality is unique and compliments\nthese two modules.\n\n``pox`` provides Python equivalents of several unix shell commands such as\n``which`` and ``find``. These commands allow automated discovery of what has\nbeen installed on an operating system, and where the essential tools are\nlocated. This capability is useful not only for exploring remote hosts,\nbut also locally as a helper utility for automated build and installation.\n\nSeveral high-level operations on files and filesystems are also provided.\nExamples of which are: finding the location of an installed Python package,\ndetermining if and where the source code resides on the filesystem, and\ndetermining what version the installed package is.\n\n``pox`` also provides utilities to enable the abstraction of commands sent\nto a remote filesystem.  In conjunction with a registry of environment\nvariables and installed utilites, ``pox`` enables the user to interact with\na remote filesystem as if they were logged in locally. \n\n``pox`` is part of ``pathos``, a Python framework for heterogeneous computing.\n``pox`` is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments,\nor suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of issues is located at https://github.com/uqfoundation/pox/issues, with a legacy list maintained at https://uqfoundation.github.io/project/pathos/query.\n\nMajor Features\n==============\n\n``pox`` provides utilities for discovering the user's environment:\n\n``pox`` also provides utilities for filesystem exploration and manipulation:\n\nCurrent Release\n===============\n\nThe latest released version of ``pox`` is available from:\n\n``pox`` is distributed under a 3-clause BSD license.\n\nDevelopment Version\n===================\n\nYou can get the latest development version with all the shiny new features at:\n\nIf you have a new contribution, please submit a pull request.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n``pox`` can be installed with ``pip``::\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n``pox`` requires:\n\nBasic Usage\n===========\n\n``pox`` includes some basic utilities to connect to and automate exploration\non local and remote filesystems. There are some basic functions to discover\nimportant locations::\n\nor, you can interact with local and global environment variables::\n\nand perform some basic search functions::\n\n``pox`` also has a specialized `which` command just for Python::\n\nAny of the ``pox`` functions can be launched from the command line,\nwhich facilitates executing commands across parallel and distributed pipes\n(such as `pathos.connection.Pipe` and `pathos.secure.connection.Pipe`)::\n\nThe functions in ``pox`` that help make interactions with filesystems and\nenvironment varialbles programmatic and abstract become especially relevant\nwhen trying to execute complex commands remotely. \n\nMore Information\n================\n\nProbably the best way to get started is to look at the documentation at\nhow ``pox`` can be used to interact with the operating system. You can run the\ntest suite with ``python -m pox.tests``.  All ``pox`` utilities\ncan be launched directly from an operating system terminal, using the ``pox``\nscript (or with ``python -m pox``).  The source code is also generally well\ndocumented, so further questions may be resolved by inspecting the code\nitself.  Please feel free to submit a ticket on github, or ask a\nquestion on stackoverflow (**@Mike McKerns**).\nIf you would like to share how you use ``pox`` in your work, please send an\nemail (to **mmckerns at uqfoundation dot org**).\n\nCitation\n========\n\nIf you use ``pox`` to do research that leads to publication, we ask that you\nacknowledge use of ``pox`` by citing the following in your publication::\n\nPlease see https://uqfoundation.github.io/project/pathos or",

  "usage_description": "This library is used to enable developers to navigate and manipulate filesystems programmatically, facilitating tasks such as identifying file system roots, retrieving user information, and determining preferred login shells. With pox, developers can automate low-level operating system interactions, making it easier to explore and interact with remote filesystems as if logged in locally."
