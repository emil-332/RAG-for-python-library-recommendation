See the [Quickstart Guide](https://strandsagents.com/) for details on configuring other model providers.\n\nInstallation\n\nEnsure you have Python 3.10+ installed, then:\n\nFeatures at a Glance\n\nPython-Based Tools\n\nEasily build tools using Python decorators:\n\n**Hot Reloading from Directory:**\nEnable automatic tool loading and reloading from the `./tools/` directory:\n\nMCP Support\n\nSeamlessly integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:\n\nMultiple Model Providers\n\nSupport for various model providers:\n\nBuilt-in providers:\n\nCustom providers can be implemented using [Custom Providers](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/custom_model_provider/)\n\nExample tools\n\nStrands offers an optional strands-agents-tools package with pre-built tools for quick experimentation:\n\nIt's also available on GitHub via [strands-agents/tools](https://github.com/strands-agents/tools).\n\nBidirectional Streaming\n\n> **⚠️ Experimental Feature**: Bidirectional streaming is currently in experimental status. APIs may change in future releases as we refine the feature based on user feedback and evolving model capabilities.\n\nBuild real-time voice and audio conversations with persistent streaming connections. Unlike traditional request-response patterns, bidirectional streaming maintains long-running conversations where users can interrupt, provide continuous input, and receive real-time audio responses. Get started with your first BidiAgent by following the [Quickstart](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/experimental/bidirectional-streaming/quickstart) guide. \n\n**Supported Model Providers:**\n- Amazon Nova Sonic (`amazon.nova-sonic-v1:0`)\n- Google Gemini Live (`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025`)\n- OpenAI Realtime API (`gpt-realtime`)\n\n**Quick Example:**\n\n**Configuration Options:**\n\nDocumentation\n\nFor detailed guidance & examples, explore our documentation:\n\nContributing ️\n\nWe welcome contributions!
