HMMER3 is developed and maintained by\nthe [Eddy/Rivas Laboratory](http://eddylab.org/) at Harvard University.\n\n`pyhmmer` is a Python package, implemented using the [Cython](https://cython.org/)\nlanguage, that provides bindings to HMMER3. It directly interacts with the\nHMMER internals, which has the following advantages over CLI wrappers\n(like [`hmmer-py`](https://pypi.org/project/hmmer/)):\n\n- **single dependency**: If your software or your analysis pipeline is\n  distributed as a Python package, you can add `pyhmmer` as a dependency to\n  your project, and stop worrying about the HMMER binaries being properly\n  setup on the end-user machine.\n- **no intermediate files**: Everything happens in memory, in Python objects\n  you have control on, making it easier to pass your inputs to HMMER without\n  needing to write them to a temporary file. Output retrieval is also done\n  in memory, via instances of the\n  [`pyhmmer.plan7.TopHits`](https://pyhmmer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/plan7/results.html#pyhmmer.plan7.TopHits)\n  class.\n- **no input formatting**: The Easel object model is exposed in the\n  [`pyhmmer.easel`](https://pyhmmer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/easel/index.html)\n  module, and you have the possibility to build a\n  [`DigitalSequence`](https://pyhmmer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/easel/seq.html#pyhmmer.easel.DigitalSequence)\n  object yourself to pass to the HMMER pipeline. This is useful if your sequences are already\n  loaded in memory, for instance because you obtained them from another\n  Python library (such as [Pyrodigal](https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal)\n  or [Biopython](https://biopython.org/)).\n- **no output parsing**: HMMER3 is notorious for its numerous output files\n  and its fixed-width tabular output, which is hard to parse (even\n  [`Bio.SearchIO.HmmerIO`](https://biopython.org/docs/dev/api/Bio.SearchIO.HmmerIO.html)\n  is struggling on some sequences).\n- **efficient**: Using `pyhmmer` to launch `hmmsearch` on sequences\n  and HMMs in disk storage is typically as fast as directly using the\n  `hmmsearch` binary (see the [Benchmarks section](#%EF%B8%8F-benchmarks)).\n  [`pyhmmer.hmmer.hmmsearch`](https://pyhmmer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/hmmer/profile.html#pyhmmer.hmmer.hmmsearch)\n  uses a different parallelisation strategy compared to\n  the `hmmsearch` binary from HMMER, which can help getting the most of\n  multiple CPUs when annotating smaller sequence databases.\n\n*This library is still a work-in-progress. It follows [semantic-versioning](https://semver.org/),\nso API changes will be documented, but past `v0.10` the API has been more or\nless stable. It should already pack enough features to run biological analyses \nor workflows involving `hmmsearch`, `hmmscan`, `nhmmer`, `phmmer`, `hmmbuild`\nand `hmmalign`.*\n\nInstalling\n\n`pyhmmer` can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyhmmer/),\nwhich hosts some pre-built CPython wheels for Linux and MacOS on x86-64 and Arm64, as well as the code required to compile from source with Cython:\n\nCompilation for UNIX PowerPC is not tested in CI, but should work out of the\nbox. Note than non-UNIX operating systems (such as Windows) are not\nsupported by HMMER.\n\nA [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) package is also available:\n\nCitation\n\nPyHMMER is scientific software, with a\n[published paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad214)\nin the [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics). Please\ncite both [PyHMMER](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04296)\nand [HMMER](http://hmmer.org) if you are using it in\nan academic work, for instance as:\n\n> PyHMMER (Larralde *et al.*, 2023), a Python library binding to HMMER (Eddy, 2011).\n\nDetailed references are available on the [Publications page](https://pyhmmer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/publications.html) of the\n[online documentation](https://pyhmmer.readthedocs.io/).\n\nDocumentation",

If you are filing in on a bug, please include as much\ninformation as you can about the issue, and try to recreate the same bug\nin a simple, easily reproducible situation.\n\n️ Contributing\n\nContributions are more than welcome! See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/althonos/pyhmmer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.\n\n⏱️ Benchmarks\n\nBenchmarks were run on a [i7-10710U CPU](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/196448/intel-core-i7-10710u-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz.html) running @1.10GHz with 6 physical / 12\nlogical cores, using a FASTA file containing 4,489 protein sequences extracted\nfrom the genome of *Escherichia coli*\n([`562.PRJEB4685`](https://progenomes.embl.de/genome.cgi))\nand the version 33.1 of the [Pfam](https://pfam.xfam.org/) HMM library containing\n18,259 domains. Commands were run 3 times on a warm SSD. *Plain lines show\nthe times for pressed HMMs, and dashed-lines the times for HMMs in text format.*\n\nRaw numbers can be found in the [`benches` folder](https://github.com/althonos/pyhmmer/blob/master/benches/).\nThey suggest that `phmmer` should be run with the number of *logical* cores,\nwhile `hmmsearch` should be run with the number of *physical* cores (or less).\nA possible explanation for this observation would be that HMMER\nplatform-specific code requires too many [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD)\nregisters per thread to benefit from [simultaneous multi-threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading).\n\nTo read more about how PyHMMER achieves better parallelism than HMMER for\nmany-to-many searches, have a look at the [Performance page](https://pyhmmer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/performance.html)\nof the documentation.\n\nSee Also\n\nBuilding a HMM from scratch? Then you may be interested in the [`pyfamsa`](https://pypi.org/project/pyfamsa/)\npackage, providing bindings to [FAMSA](https://github.com/refresh-bio/FAMSA),\na very fast multiple sequence aligner. In addition, you may want to trim alignments:\nin that case, consider [`pytrimal`](https://pypi.org/project/pytrimal), which\nwraps [trimAl 2.0](https://github.com/inab/trimal/tree/2.0_RC).\n\nIf despite of all the advantages listed earlier, you would rather use HMMER\nthrough its CLI, this package will not be of great help. You can instead check\nthe [`hmmer-py`](https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/hmmer-py) package developed\nby [Danilo Horta](https://github.com/horta) at the [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk).\n\n⚖️ License\n\nThis library is provided under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).\nThe HMMER3 and Easel code is available under the\n[BSD 3-clause](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/) license.\nSee `vendor/hmmer/LICENSE` and `vendor/easel/LICENSE` for more information.\n\nThe PyHMMER logo and figures are available under the `Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY 4.0) `_\nlicense.
