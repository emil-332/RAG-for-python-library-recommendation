Implemented algorithms include exact and approximate detection for various parametric and non-parametric models.\n`ruptures` focuses on ease of use by providing a well-documented and consistent interface.\nIn addition, thanks to its modular structure, different algorithms and models can be connected and extended within this package.\n\n**How to cite.** If you use `ruptures` in a scientific publication, we would appreciate citations to the following paper:\n\n- C. Truong, L. Oudre, N. Vayatis. Selective review of offline change point detection methods. _Signal Processing_, 167:107299, 2020.

He will integrate new algorithms in ruptures and create tutorials and illustrative examples.\n\n- NASA uses ruptures! They monitor crops in California and Iran. We submitted an article, let's hope for the best!!\n  - Jalilvand, E., Kumar, S.V., Haacker, E., Truong, C., Mahanama, S., 2024, Characterizing spatiotemporal variability in irrigation extent and timing through thermal remote sensing, submitted to Remote Sensing of Environment.\n\n- We have been contacted by CHELSEA FC to monitor players using ruptures. Stay tuned...\n\n- We use ruptures to understand the regulation of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter that plays a role in muscle contraction (involved in myasthenia gravis). Check out our work at the [Journal of Physiology](https://doi.org/10.1113/JP287243)\n\n- They use ruptures to detect changes in classroom engagement and student participation in Japan. [Check out their work](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40561-024-00317-6)\n\n- ruptures is part of a larger pipeline to observe Earth, in particular marine biodiversity. The authors use it to find change in the phytoplankton diversity. [Check out their work](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10712-024-09859-3)\n\n- We work with Croatian crystallographers (hi [Zoran Štefanić](https://www.irb.hr/eng/About-RBI/People/Zoran-Stefanic)!) to [understand protein motions using angular diagrams](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00650). We will keep you posted for our next joint publications.\n\n- [Charles Truong](https://charles.doffy.net) presented ruptures at [PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2024](https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2024/speaker/BFRLAK/).
