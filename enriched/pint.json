Due to its modular design, you can extend (or even rewrite!)\nthe complete list without changing the source code. It supports a lot of\nnumpy mathematical operations **without monkey patching or wrapping numpy**.\n\nIt has a complete test coverage. It runs in Python 3.9+ with no other dependency.\nIt is licensed under BSD.\n\nIt is extremely easy and natural to use:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\nand you can make good use of numpy if you want:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\nQuick Installation\n------------------\n\nTo install Pint, simply:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\nor utilizing conda, with the conda-forge channel:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\nand then simply enjoy it!\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFull documentation is available at http://pint.readthedocs.org/\n\nCommand-line converter\n----------------------\n\nA command-line script `pint-convert` provides a quick way to convert between\nunits or get conversion factors.\n\nDesign principles\n-----------------\n\nAlthough there are already a few very good Python packages to handle physical\nquantities, no one was really fitting my needs. Like most developers, I\nprogrammed Pint to scratch my own itches.\n\n**Unit parsing**: prefixed and pluralized forms of units are recognized without\nexplicitly defining them. In other words: as the prefix *kilo* and the unit\n*meter* are defined, Pint understands *kilometers*. This results in a much\nshorter and maintainable unit definition list as compared to other packages.\n\n**Standalone unit definitions**: units definitions are loaded from a text file\nwhich is simple and easy to edit. Adding and changing units and their\ndefinitions does not involve changing the code.\n\n**Advanced string formatting**: a quantity can be formatted into string using\n`PEP 3101`_ syntax. Extended conversion flags are given to provide symbolic,\nLaTeX and pretty formatting. Unit name translation is available if Babel_ is\ninstalled.\n\n**Free to choose the numerical type**: You can use any numerical type\n(`fraction`, `float`, `decimal`, `numpy.ndarray`, etc). NumPy_ is not required\nbut supported.\n\n**Awesome NumPy integration**: When you choose to use a NumPy_ ndarray, its methods and\nufuncs are supported including automatic conversion of units. For example\n`numpy.arccos(q)` will require a dimensionless `q` and the units of the output\nquantity will be radian.\n\n**Uncertainties integration**:  transparently handles calculations with\nquantities with uncertainties (like 3.14±0.01 meter) via the `uncertainties\npackage`_.\n\n**Handle temperature**: conversion between units with different reference\npoints, like positions on a map or absolute temperature scales.\n\n**Dependency free**: it depends only on Python and its standard library. It interacts with other packages\nlike numpy and uncertainties if they are installed\n\n**Pandas integration**: Thanks to `Pandas Extension Types`_ it is now possible to use Pint with Pandas. Operations on DataFrames and between columns are units aware, providing even more convenience for users of Pandas DataFrames. For full details, see the `pint-pandas Jupyter notebook`_.\n\nPint is maintained by a community of scientists, programmers and enthusiasts around the world.\nSee AUTHORS_ for a complete list.\n\nTo review an ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project,\nsee CHANGES_\n\n.. _Website: http://www.dimensionalanalysis.org/\n.. _`comprehensive list of physical units, prefixes and constants`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt\n.. _`uncertainties package`: https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\n.. _`NumPy`: http://www.numpy.org/\n.. _`PEP 3101`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/\n.. _`Babel`: http://babel.pocoo.org/\n.. _`Pandas Extension Types`: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/extending.html#extension-types\n.. _`pint-pandas Jupyter notebook`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint-pandas/blob/master/notebooks/pint-pandas.ipynb\n.. _`AUTHORS`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/AUTHORS\n.. _`CHANGES`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/CHANGES",
