This can be a major problem requiring manual solution. However this can be largely automatized by smart placing of the labels (difficult) or iterative adjustment of their positions to minimize overlaps (relatively easy). This library (well... script) implements the latter option to help with matplotlib graphs. Usage is very straightforward with usually pretty good results with no tweaking (most important is to just make text slightly smaller than default and maybe the figure a little larger). However the algorithm itself is highly configurable for complicated plots.\n\nGetting started\n\nInstallation\n\nShould be installable from pypi:\n\nOr with `conda`:\n\nFor the latest version from github:\n\nDocumentation\n\n[Wiki] has some basic introduction, and more advanced usage examples can be found [here].\n\nThanks to Christophe Van Neste @beukueb, **adjustText** has a simple documentation:\n\nCiting **adjustText**\n\nTo cite the library if you use it in scientific publications (or anywhere else, if you wish), please use the link to the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText) and a zenodo doi (see top of this page). Thank you!",

  "usage_description": "This library is used to automatically adjust text positions in matplotlib plots to minimize label overlaps, making it easier to effectively annotate multiple points on a graph without manual intervention. By iteratively adjusting label positions, this library helps ensure that labels are readable and do not obstruct data points or each other."
