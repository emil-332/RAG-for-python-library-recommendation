You can download and model walking, driving, or biking networks with a single line of code then analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily work with urban amenities/points of interest, building footprints, transit stops, elevation data, street orientations, speed/travel time, and routing.\n\nOSMnx 2.0 is released: read the [migration guide](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx/issues/1123).\n\nCitation\n\nIf you use OSMnx in your work, please cite the paper:\n\nBoeing, G. (2025). [Modeling and Analyzing Urban Networks and Amenities with OSMnx](https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.70009). *Geographical Analysis* 57 (4), 567-577. doi:10.1111/gean.70009\n\nGetting Started\n\nFirst read the [Getting Started](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html) guide for an introduction to the package and FAQ.\n\nThen work through the [Examples Gallery](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples) for step-by-step tutorials and sample code.\n\nInstallation\n\nFollow the [Installation](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) guide to install OSMnx.\n\nSupport\n\nIf you have any trouble, consult the [User Reference](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-reference.html). The OSMnx repository is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx).
