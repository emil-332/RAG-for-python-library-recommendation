To enable auto-tracing, call `mlflow.xyz.autolog()` before running your models. Refer to the documentation for customization and manual instrumentation.\n\nThen navigate to the \"Traces\" tab in the MLflow UI to find the trace records OpenAI query.\n\nEvaluating LLMs, Prompts, and Agents ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/index.html))\n\nThe following example runs automatic evaluation for question-answering tasks with several built-in metrics.\n\nNavigate to the \"Evaluations\" tab in the MLflow UI to find the evaluation results.\n\nTracking Model Training ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/tracking/))\n\nThe following examples trains a simple regression model with scikit-learn, while enabling MLflow's [autologging](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/autolog.html) feature for experiment tracking.\n\nOnce the above code finishes, run the following command in a separate terminal and access the MLflow UI via the printed URL. An MLflow **Run** should be automatically created, which tracks the training dataset, hyper parameters, performance metrics, the trained model, dependencies, and even more.\n\nSupport\n\n- For help or questions about MLflow usage (e.g. \"how do I do X?\") visit the [documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest).\n- In the documentation, you can ask the question to our AI-powered chat bot.
