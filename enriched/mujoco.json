Structs are provided as Python classes,\nwith Pythonic initialization and deletion semantics.\n\nIt is not the aim of this package to provide fully fledged\nscene/environment/game authoring API, as there are already a number of existing\npackages that do this well. However, this package does provide a number of\nlower-level components outside of MuJoCo itself that are likely to be useful to\nmost users who access MuJoCo through Python. For example, the `egl`, `glfw`, and\n`osmesa` subpackages contain utilities for setting up OpenGL rendering contexts.\n\nInstallation\n\nThe recommended way to install this package is via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mujoco/):\n\nA copy of the MuJoCo library is provided as part of the package and does **not**\nneed to be downloaded or installed separately.\n\nSource\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Building from source is only necessary if you are modifying the\nPython bindings (or are trying to run on exceptionally old Linux systems).\nIf that's not the case, then we recommend installing the prebuilt binaries from\nPyPI.\n\nIf you need to build the Python bindings from source, please consult\n[the documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html#building-from-source).\n\nUsage\n\nOnce installed, the package can be imported via `import mujoco`. Please consult\nour [documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python.html) for\nfurther detail on the package's API.\n\nWe recommend going through the tutorial notebook which covers the basics of\nMuJoCo using Python:\n(https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/tutorial.ipynb)\n\nVersioning\n\nThe `major.minor.micro` portion of the version number matches the version of\nMuJoCo that the bindings provide. Optionally, if we release updates to the\nPython bindings themselves that target the same version of MuJoCo, a `.postN`\nsuffix is added, for example `2.1.2.post2` represents the second update to the\nbindings for MuJoCo 2.1.2.\n\nLicense and Disclaimer\n\nCopyright 2022 DeepMind Technologies Limited\n\nMuJoCo and its Python bindings are licensed under the Apache License,\nVersion 2.0.
