Check out the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate) or have a look at our [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/tree/main/examples).\n\nLaunching script\n\nAccelerate also provides an optional CLI tool that allows you to quickly configure and test your training environment before launching the scripts. No need to remember how to use `torch.distributed.run` or to write a specific launcher for TPU training!\nOn your machine(s) just run:\n\nand answer the questions asked. This will generate a config file that will be used automatically to properly set the default options when doing\n\nFor instance, here is how you would run the GLUE example on the MRPC task (from the root of the repo):\n\nThis CLI tool is **optional**, and you can still use `python my_script.py` or `python -m torchrun my_script.py` at your convenience.\n\nYou can also directly pass in the arguments you would to `torchrun` as arguments to `accelerate launch` if you wish to not run` accelerate config`.\n\nFor example, here is how to launch on two GPUs:\n\nTo learn more, check the CLI documentation available [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/package_reference/cli).\n\nOr view the configuration zoo [here](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/blob/main/examples/config_yaml_templates/)\n\nLaunching multi-CPU run using MPI\n\nHere is another way to launch multi-CPU run using MPI. You can learn how to install Open MPI on [this page](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#easy-build). You can use Intel MPI or MVAPICH as well.\nOnce you have MPI setup on your cluster, just run:\n\nAnswer the questions that are asked, selecting to run using multi-CPU, and answer \"yes\" when asked if you want accelerate to launch mpirun.\nThen, use `accelerate launch` with your script like:\n\nAlternatively, you can use mpirun directly, without using the CLI like:\n\nLaunching training using DeepSpeed\n\nAccelerate supports training on single/multiple GPUs using DeepSpeed. To use it, you don't need to change anything in your training code; you can set everything using just `accelerate config`. However, if you desire to tweak your DeepSpeed related args from your Python script, we provide you the `DeepSpeedPlugin`.\n\nNote: DeepSpeed support is experimental for now. In case you get into some problem, please open an issue.\n\nLaunching your training from a notebook",

      "text": "Accelerate also provides a `notebook_launcher` function you can use in a notebook to launch a distributed training. This is especially useful for Colab or Kaggle notebooks with a TPU backend. Just define your training loop in a `training_function` then in your last cell, add:\n\nAn example can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/accelerate_examples/simple_nlp_example.ipynb). (https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/accelerate_examples/simple_nlp_example.ipynb)\n\nWhy should I use  Accelerate?\n\nYou should use  Accelerate when you want to easily run your training scripts in a distributed environment without having to renounce full control over your training loop. This is not a high-level framework above PyTorch, just a thin wrapper so you don't have to learn a new library. In fact, the whole API of  Accelerate is in one class, the `Accelerator` object.\n\nWhy shouldn't I use  Accelerate?\n\nYou shouldn't use  Accelerate if you don't want to write a training loop yourself. There are plenty of high-level libraries above PyTorch that will offer you that,  Accelerate is not one of them.\n\nFrameworks using  Accelerate\n\nIf you like the simplicity of  Accelerate but would prefer a higher-level abstraction around its capabilities, some frameworks and libraries that are built on top of  Accelerate are listed below:\n\n* [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion) is a toolkit for Audio, Music, and Speech Generation. Its purpose is to support reproducible research and help junior researchers and engineers get started in the field of audio, music, and speech generation research and development.\n* [Animus](https://github.com/Scitator/animus) is a minimalistic framework to run machine learning experiments. Animus highlights common \"breakpoints\" in ML experiments and provides a unified interface for them within [IExperiment](https://github.com/Scitator/animus/blob/main/animus/core.py#L76).\n* [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#getting-started) is a PyTorch framework for Deep Learning Research and Development. It focuses on reproducibility, rapid experimentation, and codebase reuse so you can create something new rather than write yet another train loop. Catalyst provides a [Runner](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/api/core.html#runner) to connect all parts of the experiment: hardware backend, data transformations, model training, and inference logic.\n* [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai#installing) is a PyTorch framework for Deep Learning that simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices. fastai provides a [Learner](https://docs.fast.ai/learner.html#Learner) to handle the training, fine-tuning, and inference of deep learning algorithms.\n* [Finetuner](https://github.com/jina-ai/finetuner) is a service that enables models to create higher-quality embeddings for semantic search, visual similarity search, cross-modal textimage search, recommendation systems, clustering, duplication detection, anomaly detection, or other uses.\n* [InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI) is a creative engine for Stable Diffusion models, offering industry-leading WebUI, terminal usage support, and serves as the foundation for many commercial products.\n* [Kornia](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/introduction.html) is a differentiable library that allows classical computer vision to be integrated into deep learning models. Kornia provides a [Trainer](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/x.html#kornia.x.Trainer) with the specific purpose to train and fine-tune the supported deep learning algorithms within the library.\n* [Open Assistant](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/) is a chat-based assistant that understands tasks, can interact with their party systems, and retrieve information dynamically to do so. \n* [pytorch-accelerated](https://github.com/Chris-hughes10/pytorch-accelerated) is a lightweight training library, with a streamlined feature set centered around a general-purpose [Trainer](https://pytorch-accelerated.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trainer.html), that places a huge emphasis on simplicity and transparency; enabling users to understand exactly what is going on under the hood, but without having to write and maintain the boilerplate themselves!\n* [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is an open-source browser-based easy-to-use interface based on the Gradio library for Stable Diffusion.\n* [torchkeras](https://github.com/lyhue1991/torchkeras) is a simple tool for training pytorch model just in a keras style, a dynamic and beautiful plot is provided in notebook to monitor your loss or metric.\n* [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) as a tool for helping train state-of-the-art machine learning models in PyTorch, Tensorflow, and JAX.
