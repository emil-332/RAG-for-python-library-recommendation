This documentation may contain a lot of work-in-progress/outdated/missing\n  parts.\n\nInstallation\n\nWe highly recommend installing\na [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).\n`coola` can be installed from pip using the following command:\n\nTo make the package as slim as possible, only the minimal packages required to use `coola` are\ninstalled.\nTo include all the dependencies, you can use the following command:\n\nPlease check the [get started page](https://durandtibo.github.io/coola/get_started) to see how to\ninstall only some specific dependencies or other alternatives to install the library.\nThe following is the corresponding `coola` versions and tested dependencies.\n\n`coola`\n----------\n`main`\n`0.11.0`\n`0.10.0`\n`0.9.1`\n\n`coola`\n----------\n`0.7.4`\n\nContributing\n\nPlease check the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nSuggestions and Communication\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute to the community.\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, you can\nsubmit [Github Issues](https://github.com/durandtibo/coola/issues).\nWe will reply to you as soon as possible. Thank you very much.\n\nAPI stability\n\n:warning: While `coola` is in development stage, no API is guaranteed to be stable from one\nrelease to the next.\nIn fact, it is very likely that the API will change multiple times before a stable 1.0.0 release.\nIn practice, this means that upgrading `coola` to a new version will possibly break any code that\nwas using the old version of `coola`.\n\nLicense\n\n`coola` is licensed under BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" license available in [LICENSE](LICENSE)\nfile.",
