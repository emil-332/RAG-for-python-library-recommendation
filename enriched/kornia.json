Whether you're using it for research or commercial purposes, consider sponsoring or collaborating with us. Your support will help ensure Kornia's growth and ongoing innovation. Reach out to us today and be a part of shaping the future of this exciting initiative!\n\nInstallation\n\n(https://pypi.org/project/kornia)\n(https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)\n\nFrom pip\n\n  \n\n  Other installation options\n\nFrom source with editable mode\n\nFor development with UV (Recommended)\n\nFor development, Kornia uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python package management and virtual environment creation. The project includes a `uv.lock` file for reproducible dependency management.\n\n  \n\nThis will set up a complete development environment with all dependencies using the lock file for reproducibility. For more details on dependency management and lock file usage, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFrom Github url (latest version)\n\nQuick Start\n\nKornia is not just another computer vision library — it's your gateway to effortless Computer Vision and AI.\n\nGet started with Kornia image transformation and augmentation!\n\nFind out Kornia ONNX models with ONNXSequential!\n\nMulti-framework support\n\nYou can now use Kornia with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). See [Multi-Framework Support](docs/source/get-started/multi-framework-support.rst) for more details.\n\n  Powered by\n\nCall For Contributors\n\nAre you passionate about computer vision, AI, and open-source development? Join us in shaping the future of Kornia! We are actively seeking contributors to help expand and enhance our library, making it even more powerful, accessible, and versatile. Whether you're an experienced developer or just starting, there's a place for you in our community.\n\nAccessible AI Models\n\nWe are excited to announce our latest advancement: a new initiative designed to seamlessly integrate lightweight AI models into Kornia.\nWe aim to run any models as smooth as big models such as StableDiffusion, to support them well in many perspectives.\nWe have already included a selection of lightweight AI models like [YuNet (Face Detection)](), [Loftr (Feature Matching)](), and [SAM (Segmentation)](). Now, we're looking for contributors to help us:\n\n- Expand the Model Selection: Import decent models into our library. If you are a researcher, Kornia is an excellent place for you to promote your model!\n- Model Optimization: Work on optimizing models to reduce their computational footprint while maintaining accuracy and performance. You may start from offering ONNX support!\n- Model Documentation: Create detailed guides and examples to help users get the most out of these models in their projects.\n\nDocumentation And Tutorial Optimization\n\nKornia's foundation lies in its extensive collection of classic computer vision operators, providing robust tools for image processing, feature extraction, and geometric transformations. We continuously seek for contributors to help us improve our documentation and present nice tutorials to our users.\n\nCite\n\nIf you are using kornia in your research-related documents, it is recommended that you cite the paper. See more in [CITATION](./CITATION.md).\n\nContributing\n\nWe appreciate all contributions. If you are planning to contribute back bug-fixes, please do so without any further discussion. If you plan to contribute new features, utility functions or extensions, please first open an issue and discuss the feature with us. Please, consider reading the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) notes. The participation in this open source project is subject to [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nCommunity\n\n  \n\nMade with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).\n\nLicense\n\nKornia is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
