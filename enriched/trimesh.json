      "text": "Basic Installation\n\nKeeping `trimesh` easy to install is a core goal, thus the *only* hard dependency is [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/). Installing other packages adds functionality but is not required. For the easiest install with just `numpy`:\n\nThe minimal install can load many supported formats (STL, PLY, OBJ, GLTF/GLB) into `numpy.ndarray` values. More functionality is available when [soft dependencies are installed](https://trimesh.org/install#dependency-overview), including convex hulls (`scipy`), graph operations (`networkx`), fast ray queries (`embreex`), vector path handling (`shapely` and `rtree`), XML formats like 3DXML/XAML/3MF (`lxml`), preview windows (`pyglet`), faster cache checks (`xxhash`), etc.\n\nTo install `trimesh` with the soft dependencies that generally install cleanly from binaries on Linux x86_64, MacOS ARM, and Windows x86_64 using `pip`:\n\nIf you are supporting a different platform or are freezing dependencies for an application we recommend you do not use extras, i.e. depend on `trimesh scipy` versus `trimesh[easy]`. Further information is available in the [advanced installation documentation](https://trimesh.org/install.html).\n\nQuick Start\n\nHere is an example of loading a mesh from file and colorizing its faces ([nicely formatted notebook version](https://trimesh.org/quick_start.html) of this example.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Import meshes from binary/ASCII STL, Wavefront OBJ, ASCII OFF, binary/ASCII PLY, GLTF/GLB 2.0, 3MF, XAML, 3DXML, etc.\n* Export meshes as GLB/GLTF, binary STL, binary PLY, ASCII OFF, OBJ, COLLADA, etc.\n* Import and export 2D or 3D vector paths with DXF or SVG files\n* Preview meshes using an OpenGL `pyglet` window, or in-line in jupyter or marimo notebooks using `three.js`\n* Automatic hashing from a subclassed numpy array for change tracking using MD5, zlib CRC, or xxhash, and internal caching of expensive values.\n* Calculate face adjacencies, face angles, vertex defects, convex hulls, etc.\n* Calculate cross sections for a 2D outline, or slice a mesh for a 3D remainder mesh, i.e. slicing for 3D-printing.\n* Split mesh based on face connectivity using networkx, or scipy.sparse\n* Calculate mass properties, including volume, center of mass, moment of inertia, principal components of inertia, etc. \n* Repair simple problems with triangle winding, normals, and quad/triangle holes\n* Compute rotation/translation/tessellation invariant identifier and find duplicate meshes\n* Check if a mesh is watertight, convex, etc.\n* Sample the surface of a mesh\n* Ray-mesh queries including location, triangle index, etc.\n* Boolean operations on meshes (intersection, union, difference) using Manifold3D or Blender.\n* Voxelize watertight meshes\n* Smooth watertight meshes using Laplacian smoothing algorithms (Classic, Taubin, Humphrey)\n* Subdivide faces of a mesh\n* Approximate minimum volume oriented bounding boxes and spheres for meshes.\n* Calculate nearest point on mesh surface and signed distance\n* Primitive objects (Box, Cylinder, Sphere, Extrusion) which are subclassed Trimesh objects and have all the same features (inertia, viewers, etc)\n* Simple scene graph and transform tree which can be rendered (pyglet window, three.js in a jupyter/marimo notebook or exported.\n* Many utility functions, like transforming points, unitizing vectors, aligning vectors, tracking numpy arrays for changes, grouping rows, etc.\n\nAdditional Notes",
