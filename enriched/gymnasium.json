      "text": "Environments\n\nGymnasium includes the following families of environments along with a wide variety of third-party environments\n* [Classic Control](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/) - These are classic reinforcement learning based on real-world problems and physics.\n* [Box2D](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/) - These environments all involve toy games based around physics control, using box2d based physics and PyGame-based rendering\n* [Toy Text](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/) - These environments are designed to be extremely simple, with small discrete state and action spaces, and hence easy to learn. As a result, they are suitable for debugging implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.\n* [MuJoCo](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/) - A physics engine based environments with multi-joint control which are more complex than the Box2D environments.\n* [Atari](https://ale.farama.org/) - Emulator of Atari 2600 ROMs simulated that have a high range of complexity for agents to learn.\n* [Third-party](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/third_party_environments/) - A number of environments have been created that are compatible with the Gymnasium API. Be aware of the version that the software was created for and use the `apply_env_compatibility` in `gymnasium.make` if necessary.\n\nInstallation\n\nTo install the base Gymnasium library, use `pip install gymnasium`\n\nThis does not include dependencies for all families of environments (there's a massive number, and some can be problematic to install on certain systems). You can install these dependencies for one family like `pip install \"gymnasium[atari]\"` or use `pip install \"gymnasium[all]\"` to install all dependencies.\n\nWe support and test for Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 on Linux and macOS. We will accept PRs related to Windows, but do not officially support it.\n\nAPI\n\nThe Gymnasium API models environments as simple Python `env` classes. Creating environment instances and interacting with them is very simple- here's an example using the \"CartPole-v1\" environment:\n\nNotable Related Libraries\n\nPlease note that this is an incomplete list, and just includes libraries that the maintainers most commonly point newcomers to when asked for recommendations.\n\n* [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) is a learning library based on the Gymnasium API. It is designed to cater to newer people in the field and provides very good reference implementations.\n* [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) is a multi-agent version of Gymnasium with a number of implemented environments, i.e. multi-agent Atari environments.\n* The Farama Foundation also has a collection of many other [environments](https://farama.org/projects) that are maintained by the same team as Gymnasium and use the Gymnasium API.\n\nEnvironment Versioning\n\nGymnasium keeps strict versioning for reproducibility reasons. All environments end in a suffix like \"-v0\".  When changes are made to environments that might impact learning results, the number is increased by one to prevent potential confusion. These were inherited from Gym.\n\nContributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community!\nPlease see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get started.\n\nSupport Gymnasium's Development\n\nIf you are financially able to do so and would like to support the development of Gymnasium, please join others in the community in [donating to us](https://github.com/sponsors/Farama-Foundation).\n\nCitation\n\nYou can cite Gymnasium using our related paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17032) as:\n\nRepository Sponsors\n\nWispr Flow\n\n  \n\nDictation that understands code\nShip 4x faster with developer-first dictation that works in every app.\n\nIf you'd like to sponsor Gymnasium or other Farama repositories and have your logo here, contact us.",
