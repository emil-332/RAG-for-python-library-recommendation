The ColoredFormatter_ class inherits from `logging.Formatter`_ and uses\n`ANSI escape sequences`_ to render your logging messages in color. It uses only\nstandard colors so it should work on any UNIX terminal. It's currently tested\non Python 2.7, 3.5+ and PyPy (2 and 3). On Windows `coloredlogs` automatically\ntries to enable native ANSI support (on up-to-date Windows 10 installations)\nand falls back on using colorama_ (if installed). Here is a screen shot of the\ndemo that is printed when the command ``coloredlogs --demo`` is executed:\n\n.. image:: https://coloredlogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/defaults.png\n\nNote that the screenshot above includes custom logging levels defined by my\nverboselogs_ package: if you install both `coloredlogs` and `verboselogs` it\nwill Just Work (`verboselogs` is of course not required to use\n`coloredlogs`).\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe `coloredlogs` package is available on PyPI_ which means installation should\nbe as simple as:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n$ pip install coloredlogs\n\nThere's actually a multitude of ways to install Python packages (e.g. the `per\nuser site-packages directory`_, `virtual environments`_ or just installing\nsystem wide) and I have no intention of getting into that discussion here, so\nif this intimidates you then read up on your options before returning to these\ninstructions .\n\nOptional dependencies\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNative ANSI support on Windows requires an up-to-date Windows 10 installation.\nIf this is not working for you then consider installing the colorama_ package:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n$ pip install colorama\n\nOnce colorama_ is installed it will be used automatically.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nHere's an example of how easy it is to get started:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\nimport coloredlogs, logging\n\n# Create a logger object.\n   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# By default the install() function installs a handler on the root logger,\n   # this means that log messages from your code and log messages from the\n   # libraries that you use will all show up on the terminal.\n   coloredlogs.install(level='DEBUG')\n\n# If you don't want to see log messages from libraries, you can pass a\n   # specific logger object to the install() function. In this case only log\n   # messages originating from that logger will show up on the terminal.\n   coloredlogs.install(level='DEBUG', logger=logger)\n\n# Some examples.\n   logger.debug(\"this is a debugging message\")\n   logger.info(\"this is an informational message\")\n   logger.warning(\"this is a warning message\")\n   logger.error(\"this is an error message\")\n   logger.critical(\"this is a critical message\")\n\nFormat of log messages\n----------------------\n\nThe ColoredFormatter_ class supports user defined log formats so you can use\nany log format you like. The default log format is as follows::\n\n%(asctime)s %(hostname)s %(name)s[%(process)d] %(levelname)s %(message)s\n\nThis log format results in the following output::\n\n2015-10-23 03:32:22 peter-macbook coloredlogs.demo[30462] DEBUG message with level 'debug'\n 2015-10-23 03:32:23 peter-macbook coloredlogs.demo[30462] VERBOSE message with level 'verbose'\n 2015-10-23 03:32:24 peter-macbook coloredlogs.demo[30462] INFO message with level 'info'\n ...\n\nYou can customize the log format and styling using environment variables as\nwell as programmatically, please refer to the `online documentation`_ for\ndetails.",

      "text": "Enabling millisecond precision\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you're switching from `logging.basicConfig()`_ to `coloredlogs.install()`_\nyou may notice that timestamps no longer include milliseconds. This is because\ncoloredlogs doesn't output milliseconds in timestamps unless you explicitly\ntell it to. There are three ways to do that:\n\n1. The easy way is to pass the `milliseconds` argument to `coloredlogs.install()`_::\n\nThis became supported in `release 7.1`_ (due to `#16`_).\n\n2. Alternatively you can change the log format `to include 'msecs'`_::\n\nHere's what the call to `coloredlogs.install()`_ would then look like::\n\nCustomizing the log format also enables you to change the delimiter that\n   separates seconds from milliseconds (the comma above). This became possible\n   in `release 3.0`_ which added support for user defined log formats.\n\n3. If the use of ``%(msecs)d`` isn't flexible enough you can instead add ``%f``\n   to the date/time format, it will be replaced by the value of ``%(msecs)03d``.\n   Support for the ``%f`` directive was added to `release 9.3`_ (due to `#45`_).\n\nCustom logging fields\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe following custom log format fields are supported:\n\n- ``%(hostname)s`` provides the hostname of the local system.\n- ``%(programname)s`` provides the name of the currently running program.\n- ``%(username)s`` provides the username of the currently logged in user.\n\nWhen `coloredlogs.install()`_ detects that any of these fields are used in the\nformat string the applicable logging.Filter_ subclasses are automatically\nregistered to populate the relevant log record fields.\n\nChanging text styles and colors\n-------------------------------\n\nThe online documentation contains `an example of customizing the text styles and\ncolors `_.\n\nColored output from cron\n------------------------\n\nWhen `coloredlogs` is used in a cron_ job, the output that's e-mailed to you by\ncron won't contain any ANSI escape sequences because `coloredlogs` realizes\nthat it's not attached to an interactive terminal. If you'd like to have colors\ne-mailed to you by cron there are two ways to make it happen:\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nModifying your crontab\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere's an example of a minimal crontab::\n\nThe ``coloredlogs`` program is installed when you install the `coloredlogs`\nPython package. When you execute ``coloredlogs --to-html your-command`` it runs\n``your-command`` under the external program ``script`` (you need to have this\ninstalled). This makes ``your-command`` think that it's attached to an\ninteractive terminal which means it will output ANSI escape sequences which\nwill then be converted to HTML by the ``coloredlogs`` program. Yes, this is a\nbit convoluted, but it works great :-)\n\nModifying your Python code\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ColoredCronMailer_ class provides a context manager that automatically\nenables HTML output when the ``$CONTENT_TYPE`` variable has been correctly set\nin the crontab.\n\nThis requires my capturer_ package which you can install using ``pip install\n'coloredlogs[cron]'``. The ``[cron]`` extra will pull in capturer_ 2.4 or newer\nwhich is required to capture the output while silencing it - otherwise you'd\nget duplicate output in the emails sent by ``cron``.",
