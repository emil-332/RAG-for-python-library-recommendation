It is designed to be a perfect fit for production environments where you want:\n\n- **⚡️ Faster Deployment**: The package size and dependencies are significantly smaller than the full MLflow package, allowing for faster deployment times in dynamic environments such as Docker containers, serverless functions, and cloud-based applications.\n- ** Simplified Dependency Management**: A smaller set of dependencies means less work keeping up with dependency updates, security patches, and breaking changes from upstream libraries.\n- ** Portability**: With the less number of dependencies, MLflow Tracing can be easily deployed across different environments and platforms, without worrying about compatibility issues.\n- ** Fewer Security Risks**: Each dependency potentially introduces security vulnerabilities. By reducing the number of dependencies, MLflow Tracing minimizes the attack surface and reduces the risk of security breaches.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Other tracing APIs such as `mlflow.set_trace_tag`, `mlflow.search_traces`, etc.\n\nChoose Backend\n\nThe MLflow Trace package is designed to work with a remote hosted MLflow server as a backend. This allows you to log your traces to a central location, making it easier to manage and analyze your traces. There are several different options for hosting your MLflow server, including:\n\nGetting Started\n\nInstallation\n\nTo install the MLflow Python package, run the following command:\n\nTo install from the source code, run the following command:\n\n> **NOTE:** It is **not** recommended to co-install this package with the full MLflow package together, as it may cause version mismatches issues.\n\nConnect to the MLflow Server\n\nTo connect to your MLflow server to log your traces, set the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable or use the `mlflow.set_tracking_uri` function:\n\nStart Logging Traces\n\nDocumentation\n\nOfficial documentation for MLflow Tracing can be found at [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracing).\n\nFeatures _Not_ Included\n\nThe following MLflow features are not included in this package.\n\n- MLflow tracking server and UI.\n- MLflow's other tracking capabilities such as Runs, Model Registry, Projects, etc.\n- Evaluate models/agents and log evaluation results.\n\nTo leverage the full feature set of MLflow, install the full package by running `pip install mlflow`.",
