See\nthe [documentation](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli) for installation and usage, and\nthe [install instructions](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli/install) for a quick start.\n\n**This library does not support Singularity 2.x! It won't work and we no longer support it.**\n\nWe provide a [Singularity](Singularity) recipe for you to use if more convenient, along with the [full modules docstring](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli/api/source/spython.main.base.html#module-spython.main.base).\n\nAs of version 0.1.0, we only support Singularity > 3.5.2. This is done to encourage using\nnewer versions of Singularity with security fixes. If you want to use an older version of Singularity,\nyou will need to use version 0.0.85 or earlier.\n\n️ Contributors ️\n\nWe use the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors)\ntool to generate a contributors graphic below.\n\nLicense\n\nThis code is licensed under the MPL 2.0 [LICENSE](LICENSE).\n\nHelp and Contribution\n\nPlease contribute to the package, or post feedback and questions as issues.
