If you need help setting up a development environment for use with\nMediaPipe Tasks, check out the setup guides for\n[Android](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/setup_android), [web\napps](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/setup_web), and\n[Python](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/setup_python).\n\nSolutions\n\nMediaPipe Solutions provides a suite of libraries and tools for you to quickly\napply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in your\napplications. You can plug these solutions into your applications immediately,\ncustomize them to your needs, and use them across multiple development\nplatforms. MediaPipe Solutions is part of the MediaPipe [open source\nproject](https://github.com/google/mediapipe), so you can further customize the\nsolutions code to meet your application needs.\n\nThese libraries and resources provide the core functionality for each MediaPipe\nSolution:\n\n*   **MediaPipe Tasks**: Cross-platform APIs and libraries for deploying\n*   **MediaPipe models**: Pre-trained, ready-to-run models for use with each\n\nThese tools let you customize and evaluate solutions:\n\n*   **MediaPipe Model Maker**: Customize models for solutions with your data.\n*   **MediaPipe Studio**: Visualize, evaluate, and benchmark solutions in your\n\nLegacy solutions\n\nWe have ended support for [these MediaPipe Legacy Solutions](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/guide#legacy)\nas of March 1, 2023. All other MediaPipe Legacy Solutions will be upgraded to\na new MediaPipe Solution. See the [Solutions guide](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/guide#legacy)\nfor details. The [code repository](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe)\nand prebuilt binaries for all MediaPipe Legacy Solutions will continue to be\nprovided on an as-is basis.\n\nFor more on the legacy solutions, see the [documentation](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/docs/solutions).\n\nFramework\n\nTo start using MediaPipe Framework, [install MediaPipe\nFramework](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/framework/getting_started/install)\nand start building example applications in C++, Android, and iOS.\n\n[MediaPipe Framework](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/framework) is the\nlow-level component used to build efficient on-device machine learning\npipelines, similar to the premade MediaPipe Solutions.\n\nBefore using MediaPipe Framework, familiarize yourself with the following key\n[Framework\nconcepts](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/framework/framework_concepts/overview.md):\n\n*   [Packets](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/framework/framework_concepts/packets.md)\n*   [Graphs](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/framework/framework_concepts/graphs.md)\n*   [Calculators](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/framework/framework_concepts/calculators.md)\n\nCommunity\n\n*   [Slack community](https://mediapipe.page.link/joinslack) for MediaPipe\n*   [Discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mediapipe) - General\n*   [Awesome MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.page.link/awesome-mediapipe) - A\n\nContributing\n\nWe welcome contributions.
