  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to provide safe and convenient access to XML processing capabilities, including XPath, RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N, and more, through the ElementTree API. With lxml, developers can efficiently parse, transform, and validate XML documents in Python, leveraging a powerful combination of libxml2/libxslt and Pythonic syntax."
