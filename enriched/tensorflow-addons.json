TensorFlow natively supports a large number of\noperators, layers, metrics, losses, and optimizers. However, in a fast\nmoving field like ML, there are many interesting new developments that\ncannot be integrated into core TensorFlow (because their broad\napplicability is not yet clear, or it is mostly used by a smaller subset\nof the community).",
