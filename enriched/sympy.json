In February\n2007, Fabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fix many things,\ncontributed documentation, and made it alive again. 5 students (Mateusz\nPaprocki, Brian Jorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz, and Chris Wu)\nimproved SymPy incredibly during summer 2007 as part of the Google\nSummer of Code. Pearu Peterson joined the development during the summer\n2007 and he has made SymPy much more competitive by rewriting the core\nfrom scratch, which has made it from 10x to 100x faster. Jurjen N.E. Bos\nhas contributed pretty-printing and other patches. Fredrik Johansson has\nwritten mpmath and contributed a lot of patches.\n\nSymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007. You\ncan see  for\nfull details. Each year has improved SymPy by bounds. Most of SymPy's\ndevelopment has come from Google Summer of Code students.\n\nIn 2011, Ondřej Čertík stepped down as lead developer, with Aaron\nMeurer, who also started as a Google Summer of Code student, taking his\nplace. Ondřej Čertík is still active in the community but is too busy\nwith work and family to play a lead development role.\n\nSince then, a lot more people have joined the development and some\npeople have also left. You can see the full list in doc/src/aboutus.rst,\nor online at:\n\nThe git history goes back to 2007 when development moved from svn to hg.\nTo see the history before that point, look at\n.\n\nYou can use git to see the biggest developers. The command:\n\nwill show each developer, sorted by commits to the project. The command:\n\nwill show the top developers from the last year.\n\nCitation\n\nTo cite SymPy in publications use",
