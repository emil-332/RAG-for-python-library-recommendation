      "text": "Welcome to the huggingface_hub library\n\nThe `huggingface_hub` library allows you to interact with the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/), a platform democratizing open-source Machine Learning for creators and collaborators. Discover pre-trained models and datasets for your projects or play with the thousands of machine learning apps hosted on the Hub. You can also create and share your own models, datasets and demos with the community. The `huggingface_hub` library provides a simple way to do all these things with Python.\n\nKey features\n\nInstallation\n\nInstall the `huggingface_hub` package with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/huggingface-hub/):\n\nIf you prefer, you can also install it with [conda](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/installation#install-with-conda).\n\nIn order to keep the package minimal by default, `huggingface_hub` comes with optional dependencies useful for some use cases. For example, if you want to use the MCP module, run:\n\nTo learn more installation and optional dependencies, check out the [installation guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/installation).\n\nQuick start\n\nDownload files\n\nDownload a single file\n\nOr an entire repository\n\nFiles will be downloaded in a local cache folder. More details in [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/manage-cache).\n\nLogin\n\nThe Hugging Face Hub uses tokens to authenticate applications (see [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens)). To log in your machine, run the following CLI:\n\nCreate a repository\n\nUpload files\n\nUpload a single file\n\nOr an entire folder\n\nFor details in the [upload guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/upload).\n\nIntegrating to the Hub.\n\nWe're partnering with cool open source ML libraries to provide free model hosting and versioning. You can find the existing integrations [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/libraries).\n\nThe advantages are:\n\n- Free model or dataset hosting for libraries and their users.\n- Built-in file versioning, even with very large files, thanks to a git-based approach.\n- In-browser widgets to play with the uploaded models.\n- Anyone can upload a new model for your library, they just need to add the corresponding tag for the model to be discoverable.\n- Fast downloads! We use Cloudfront (a CDN) to geo-replicate downloads so they're blazing fast from anywhere on the globe.\n- Usage stats and more features to come.\n\nIf you would like to integrate your library, feel free to open an issue to begin the discussion. We wrote a [step-by-step guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/adding-a-library) with ️ showing how to do this integration.\n\nContributions (feature requests, bugs, etc.) are super welcome ️\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code is not the only way to help the community.\nAnswering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to the community.\nWe wrote a [contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to summarize\nhow to get started to contribute to this repository.",
