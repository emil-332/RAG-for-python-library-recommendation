It implements\nseveral methods for sequential model-based optimization. ``skopt`` aims\nto be accessible and easy to use in many contexts.\n\nThe library is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-Learn.\n\nWe do not perform gradient-based optimization. For gradient-based\noptimization algorithms look at\n``scipy.optimize``\n`here `_.\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holgern/scikit-optimize/main/media/bo-objective.png\n   :alt: Approximated objective\n\nApproximated objective function after 50 iterations of ``gp_minimize``.\nPlot made using ``skopt.plots.plot_objective``.\n\nMaintaining the codebase\n------------------------\nThis repo is a copy of the original repositoy at https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize/.\nAs the original repo is now in read-only mode, i decided to continue the development on it on my own.\nI still have credentials for pypi, so I will publish new releases at https://pypi.org/project/scikit-optimize/.\nI did my best to include all open PR since 2021 in the new release of scikit-optimize 0.10.\n\nImportant links\n---------------\n\n-  Project website https://scikit-optimize.readthedocs.io/\n-  Example notebooks - can be found in examples_.\n-  `Discussion forum\n   `__\n-  Issue tracker -\n-  Releases - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-optimize\n-  Conda feedstock - https://github.com/conda-forge/scikit-optimize-feedstock\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nscikit-optimize requires\n\n* Python >= 3.8\n* NumPy (>= 1.20.3)\n* SciPy (>= 0.19.1)\n* joblib (>= 0.11)\n* scikit-learn >= 1.0.0\n* matplotlib >= 2.0.0\n\nYou can install the latest release with:\n::\n\nThis installs the essentials. To install plotting functionality,\nyou can instead do:\n::\n\nThis will additionally install Matplotlib.\n\nIf you're using Anaconda platform, there is a `conda-forge `_\npackage of scikit-optimize:\n::\n\nUsing conda-forge is probably the easiest way to install scikit-optimize on\nWindows.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nFind the minimum of the noisy function ``f(x)`` over the range\n``-2 `__\nand the other examples_.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nThe library is still experimental and under development. Checkout\nthe `next\nmilestone `__\nfor the plans for the next release or look at some `easy\nissues `__\nto get started contributing.\n\nThe development version can be installed through:\n\n::\n\nRun all tests by executing ``pytest`` in the top level directory.\n\nTo only run the subset of tests with short run time, you can use ``pytest -m 'fast_test'`` (``pytest -m 'slow_test'`` is also possible). To exclude all slow running tests try ``pytest -m 'not slow_test'``.\n\nThis is implemented using pytest `attributes `__. If a tests runs longer than 1 second, it is marked as slow, else as fast.\n\nAll contributors are welcome!\n\nPre-commit-config\n-----------------\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::\n\nUsing homebrew\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::\n\nInstall the git hook scripts\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::\n\nRun against all the files\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::\n\nUpdate package rev in pre-commit yaml\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::\n\nMaking a Release\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe release procedure is almost completely automated. By tagging a new release,\nCI will build all required packages and push them to PyPI. To make a release,\ncreate a new issue and work through the following checklist:\n\n* [ ] check if the dependencies in `setup.py` are valid or need unpinning,\n* [ ] check that the `doc/whats_new/v0.X.rst` is up-to-date,\n* [ ] did the last build of master succeed?\n* [ ] create a [new release](https://github.com/holgern/scikit-optimize/releases),\n* [ ] ping [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/scikit-optimize-feedstock).\n\nBefore making a release, we usually create a release candidate. If the next\nrelease is v0.X, then the release candidate should be tagged v0.Xrc1.\nMark the release candidate as a \"pre-release\" on GitHub when you tag it.\n\nMade possible by\n----------------\n\nThe scikit-optimize project was made possible with the support of\n\n.. image:: https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18165687?v=4&s=128\n   :alt: Wild Tree Tech\n   :target: https://wildtreetech.com\n\n.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/lgxboT5.jpg\n\n.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/V1VSIvj.jpg\n\n.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/3enQ6S8.jpg\n\nIf your employer allows you to work on scikit-optimize during the day and would like\nrecognition, feel free to add them to the \"Made possible by\" list.\n\n.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scikit-optimize.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-optimize\n\n   :target: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scikit-optimize\n\n   :target: https://github.com/holgern/scikit-optimize/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain\n.. |Logo| image:: https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18578550?v=4&s=80\n\n   :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/holgern/scikit-optimize/main?filepath=examples\n\n   :target: https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10804382\n.. |scipy.optimize| replace:: ``scipy.optimize``\n.. _scipy.optimize: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html\n.. _examples: https://scikit-optimize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html\n\n   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/holgern/scikit-optimize",
