It facilitates web navigation through a set of\nfilters, enhancing the quality of resulting document collections:\n\n- Save bandwidth and processing time by steering clear of pages deemed\n  low-value\n- Identify specific pages based on language or text content\n- Pinpoint pages relevant for efficient link gathering\n\nAdditional utilities needed include URL storage, filtering, and\ndeduplication.\n\nFeatures\n\nSeparate the wheat from the chaff and optimize document discovery and\nretrieval:\n\n- URL handling\n   - Validation\n   - Normalization\n   - Sampling\n- Heuristics for link filtering\n   - Spam, trackers, and content-types\n   - Locales and internationalization\n   - Web crawling (frontier, scheduling)\n- Data store specifically designed for URLs\n- Usable with Python or on the command-line\n\n**Let the coURLan fish up juicy bits for you!**\n\nHere is a [courlan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/courlan) (source:\n[Limpkin at Harn's Marsh by\nRuss](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Limpkin,_harns_marsh_(33723700146).jpg),\nCC BY 2.0).\n\nInstallation\n\nThis package is compatible with with all common versions of Python, it\nis tested on Linux, macOS and Windows systems.\n\nCourlan is available on the package repository [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)\nand can notably be installed with the Python package manager `pip`:\n\nThe last version to support Python 3.6 and 3.7 is `courlan==1.2.0`.\n\nPython\n\nMost filters revolve around the `strict` and `language` arguments.\n\ncheck_url()\n\nAll useful operations chained in `check_url(url)`:\n\nLanguage-aware heuristics, notably internationalization in URLs, are\navailable in `lang_filter(url, language)`:\n\nDefine stricter restrictions on the expected content type with\n`strict=True`. This also blocks certain platforms and page types\nwhere machines get lost.\n\nSampling by domain name\n\nWeb crawling and URL handling\n\nLink extraction and preprocessing:\n\nThe `filter_links()` function provides additional filters for crawling purposes:\nuse of robots.txt rules and link priorization. See `courlan.core` for details.\n\nDetermine if a link leads to another host:\n\nOther useful functions dedicated to URL handling:\n\n-   `extract_domain(url, fast=True)`: find domain and subdomain or just\n-   `get_base_url(url)`: strip the URL of some of its parts\n-   `get_host_and_path(url)`: decompose URLs in two parts: protocol +\n-   `get_hostinfo(url)`: extract domain and host info (protocol +\n-   `fix_relative_urls(baseurl, url)`: prepend necessary information to\n\nOther filters dedicated to crawl frontier management:\n\n-   `is_not_crawlable(url)`: check for deep web or pages generally not\n-   `is_navigation_page(url)`: check for navigation and overview pages\n\nSee also [URL management page](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/url-management.html)\nof the Trafilatura documentation.\n\nPython helpers\n\nHelper function, scrub and normalize:\n\nBasic scrubbing only:\n\nBasic canonicalization/normalization only, i.e. modifying and\nstandardizing URLs in a consistent manner:\n\nBasic URL validation only:\n\nTroubleshooting",
