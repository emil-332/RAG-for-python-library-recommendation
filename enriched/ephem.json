It is\nhosted at:\n\nIf you lack expertise with version control, you can instead simply\ndownload a static copy of the most recent source code using this link:\n\nTo run its source code in place, create a `virtual environment\n`_, activate\nit, change directory to the root of the PyEphem source code, and run::\n\nYou can then run the PyEphem test suite to see whether all of its\nfeatures are working correctly on your operating system and platform::\n\nPyEphem’s documentation is organized as a standard `Sphinx\n`_ document project.  You can\nbuild the documentation either with the Sphinx command line::\n\n— or, more typically, by invoking one of the targets in the\ndocumentation’s Makefile::",
