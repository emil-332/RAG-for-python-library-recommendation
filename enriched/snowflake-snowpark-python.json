The Snowpark pandas API provides a familiar interface for pandas users to query and process data directly in Snowflake.\n\nCreate a session and use the Snowpark Python API\n\nCreate a session and use the Snowpark pandas API\n\nSamples\nThe [Snowpark Python developer guide][Snowpark Python developer guide], [Snowpark Python API references][Snowpark Python api references], [Snowpark pandas developer guide][Snowpark pandas developer guide], and [Snowpark pandas api references][Snowpark pandas api references] have basic sample code.\n[Snowflake-Labs][snowflake lab sample code] has more curated demos.\n\nLogging\nConfigure logging level for `snowflake.snowpark` for Snowpark Python API logs.\nSnowpark uses the [Snowflake Python Connector][python connector].\nSo you may also want to configure the logging level for `snowflake.connector` when the error is in the Python Connector.\nFor instance,\n\nReading and writing to pandas DataFrame\n\nSnowpark Python API supports reading from and writing to a pandas DataFrame via the [to_pandas][to_pandas] and [write_pandas][write_pandas] commands. \n\nTo use these operations, ensure that pandas is installed in the same environment. You can install pandas alongside Snowpark Python by executing the following command:\n\nOnce pandas is installed, you can convert between a Snowpark DataFrame and pandas DataFrame as follows: \n\nSnowpark pandas API also supports writing to pandas: \n\nNote that the above Snowpark pandas commands will work if Snowpark is installed with the `[modin]` option, the additional `[pandas]` installation is not required.\n\nVerifying Package Signatures\n\nTo ensure the authenticity and integrity of the Python package, follow the steps below to verify the package signature using `cosign`.\n\n**Steps to verify the signature:**\n- Install cosign:\n  - This example is using golang installation: [installing-cosign-with-go](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/how-to-install-cosign/#installing-cosign-with-go)\n- Download the file from the repository like pypi:\n  - https://pypi.org/project/snowflake-snowpark-python/#files\n- Download the signature files from the release tag, replace the version number with the version you are verifying:\n  - https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowpark-python/releases/tag/v1.22.1\n- Verify signature:\n  `\n\nContributing\nPlease refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md][contributing].\n\n[add other sample code repo links]: # (Developer advocacy is open-sourcing a repo that has excellent sample code. The link will be added here.)",
