  "usage_description": "This library is used to perform advanced statistical analysis of time-to-event data, allowing developers to easily model and visualize survival distributions using methods such as Kaplan Meier and Nelson Aalen. With lifelines, developers can build sophisticated models that account for regression effects on survival times."
