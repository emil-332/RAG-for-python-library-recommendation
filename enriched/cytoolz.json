It is designed to interoperate seamlessly with other\nlibraries including ``itertools``, ``functools``, and third party libraries.\nHigh performance functional data analysis is possible with builtin types\nlike ``list`` and ``dict``, and user-defined data structures; and low memory\nusage is achieved by using the iterator protocol and returning iterators\nwhenever possible.\n\n``cytoolz`` implements the same API as ``toolz``.  The main differences are\nthat ``cytoolz`` is faster (typically 2-5x faster with a few spectacular\nexceptions) and ``cytoolz`` offers a C API that is accessible to other\nprojects developed in Cython.  Since ``toolz`` is able to process very\nlarge (potentially infinite) data sets, the performance increase gained by\nusing ``cytoolz`` can be significant.\n\nSee the PyToolz documentation at https://toolz.readthedocs.io and the full\n`API Documentation `__\nfor more details.\n\n*CyToolz has experimental support for Python free-threading introduced in\nPython 3.13 and provides wheels for free-threaded Python. CyToolz has not\nyet been developed or tested for thread-safety, so use at your own risk!\nIf you encounter any issues, please*\n`let us know `__.\n\nLICENSE\n-------\n\nNew BSD. See `License File `__.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n``cytoolz`` is on the Python Package Index (PyPI):\n\n::\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n``cytoolz`` supports Python 3.9+ with a common codebase.\nIt is developed in Cython, but requires no dependecies other than CPython\nand a C compiler.  Like ``toolz``, it is a light weight dependency.\n\nContributions Welcome\n---------------------\n\n``toolz`` (and ``cytoolz``) aims to be a repository for utility functions,\nparticularly those that come from the functional programming and list\nprocessing traditions. We welcome contributions that fall within this scope\nand encourage users to scrape their ``util.py`` files for functions that are\nbroadly useful.\n\nPlease take a look at our issue pages for\n`toolz `__ and\n`cytoolz `__\nfor contribution ideas.\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\nSee our `mailing list `__.\nWe're friendly.\n\n   :target: https://github.com/pytoolz/cytoolz/actions",
