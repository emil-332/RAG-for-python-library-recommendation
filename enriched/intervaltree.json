Queries may be by point, by range overlap, or by range envelopment.\n\nThis library was designed to allow tagging text and time intervals, where the intervals include the lower bound but not the upper bound.\n\n**Version 3 changes!**\n\n* The `search(begin, end, strict)` method no longer exists. Instead, use one of these:\n* The `extend(items)` method no longer exists. Instead, use `update(items)`.\n* Methods like `merge_overlaps()` which took a `strict` argument consistently default to `strict=True`. Before, some methods defaulted to `True` and others to `False`.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.5+ (Tested under 2.7, and 3.5 thru 3.14)\n* Initializing\n\n* Insertions\n\n* Deletions\n\n* Point queries\n\n* Overlap queries\n\n* Envelop queries\n\n* Membership queries\n\n* Iterable\n\n* Sizing\n\n* Set-like operations\n\n* Restructuring\n\n* Copying and typecasting\n\n* Pickle-friendly\n* Automatic AVL balancing\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n* Getting started\n\n* Adding intervals - any object works!\n\n* Query by point\n\n* Query by range\n\nFuture improvements\n-------------------\n\nSee the [issue tracker][] on GitHub.\n\nBased on\n--------\n\n* Eternally Confuzzled's [AVL tree][Confuzzled AVL tree]\n* Wikipedia's [Interval Tree][Wiki intervaltree]\n* Heavily modified from Tyler Kahn's [Interval Tree implementation in Python][Kahn intervaltree] ([GitHub project][Kahn intervaltree GH])\n* Incorporates contributions from:\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\n* [Chaim Leib Halbert][GH], 2013-2025\n* Modifications, [Konstantin Tretyakov][Konstantin intervaltree], 2014\n\nLicensed under the [Apache License, version 2.0][Apache].\n\nThe source code for this project is at https://github.com/chaimleib/intervaltree",

  "usage_description": "This library is used to efficiently store, query, and manage intervals in a data structure that supports point, range overlap, and range envelopment queries. Developers can use it to tag text or time intervals with the specified lower bound and automatically manage overlapping or adjacent intervals for efficient storage and querying."
