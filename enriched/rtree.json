These features include:\n\n* Nearest neighbor search\n* Intersection search\n* Multi-dimensional indexes\n* Clustered indexes (store Python pickles directly with index entries)\n* Bulk loading\n* Deletion\n* Disk serialization\n* Custom storage implementation (to implement spatial indexing in ZODB, for example)\n\nWheels are available for most major platforms, and `rtree` with bundled `libspatialindex` can be installed via pip:\n\nSee [changes](https://rtree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html) for all versions.",
