There are many\ndifferent protocols, sent over many different interfaces and bus systems\n(GPIB, RS232, USB). For every programming language you want to use, you have to\nfind libraries that support both your device and its bus system.\n\nIn order to ease this unfortunate situation, the Virtual Instrument Software\nArchitecture (VISA_) specification was defined in the middle of the 90's. Today\nVISA is implemented on all significant operating systems. A couple of vendors\noffer VISA libraries, partly with free download. These libraries work together\nwith arbitrary peripheral devices, although they may be limited to certain\ninterface devices, such as the vendor’s GPIB card.\n\nThe VISA specification has explicit bindings to Visual Basic, C, and G\n(LabVIEW’s graphical language). Python can be used to call functions from a\nVISA shared library (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`) allowing to directly leverage the\nstandard implementations. In addition, Python can be used to directly access\nmost bus systems used by instruments which is why one can envision to implement\nthe VISA standard directly in Python (see the `PyVISA-Py`_ project for more\ndetails). PyVISA is both a Python wrapper for VISA shared libraries but\ncan also serve as a front-end for other VISA implementation such as\n`PyVISA-Py`_.\n\n.. _VISA: http://www.ivifoundation.org/specifications/default.aspx\n.. _`PyVISA-Py`: http://pyvisa-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nVISA and Python\n---------------\n\nPython has a couple of features that make it very interesting for controlling\ninstruments:\n\n- Python is an easy-to-learn scripting language with short development cycles.\n- It represents a high abstraction level [2], which perfectly blends with the\n  abstraction level of measurement programs.\n- It has a rich set of native libraries, including numerical and plotting\n  modules for data analysis and visualisation.\n- A large set of books (in many languages) and on-line publications is\n  available.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- Python (tested with 3.10+)\n- VISA (tested with NI-VISA 17.5, Win7, from www.ni.com/visa and Keysight-VISA )\n\nInstallation\n--------------\n\nUsing pip:\n\nor easy_install:\n\nor download and unzip the source distribution file and:\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\nThe documentation can be read online at https://pyvisa.readthedocs.org\n\nCiting\n------\n\nIf you are using this package, you can cite the `PyVISA publication`_\n\nGrecco et al., (2023).

  "usage_description": "This library is used to control various measurement devices and test equipment through a standardized interface, supporting GPIB, RS232, TCPIP, and USB connections. With pyvisa, developers can write Python scripts to interact with instruments from multiple vendors, simplifying the programming process for instrument control applications."
