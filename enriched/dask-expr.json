  "usage_description": "This library is used to optimize and execute complex data queries on large datasets, rewriting user code into an optimized expression tree for efficient execution with Dask DataFrames. It provides a high-level interface for query optimization and improved organization of Dask DataFrame operations, covering almost the entire Dask DataFrame API."
