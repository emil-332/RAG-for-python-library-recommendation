  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to accelerate and optimize high-level data processing operations on Dask DataFrames, leveraging query optimization for improved performance. With dask-expr, developers can write complex queries in an expression tree format that gets optimized and executed efficiently, making it suitable as the default backend for Dask DataFrames since version 2024.3.0."
