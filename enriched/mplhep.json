Therefore the font in a figure can be dependent on whether it was produced on OSX or PC. The default sans-serif font used is Helvetica, but it only comes with OSX, in Windows this will silently fallback to Arial.\n\nLicense\nBoth Helvetica and Arial are proprietary, which as far as fonts go means you can use it to create any text/graphics once you have the license, but you cannot redistribute the font files as part of other software. That means we cannot just package Helvetica with this to make sure everyone has the same font in plots.\n\nLuckily for fonts it seems only the software is copyrighted, not the actual shapes, which means there are quite a few open alternatives with similar look. The most closely resembling Helvetica being Tex Gyre Heros\n\nTex Gyre Heros\n\nYou can compare yourself if the differences are meanigful below.\n\n  \n\nThey are Tex Gyre Heros, Helvetica and Arial respectively.\n\nMath Fonts\n- Math fonts are a separate set from regular fonts due to the amount of special characters\n- It's not trivial to make sure you get a matching math font to your regular font\n- Most math-fonts are serif fonts, but this is not ideal if one wants to use sans-serif font for normal text like Helvetica or Arial\n- The number of sans-serif math-fonts is very limited\n \t- The number of **open** sans-serif math-fonts is **extremely** limited\n \t- Basically there's two, Fira Sans and GFS Neohellenic Math, of which I like Fira Sans better\n \t- https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/374250/are-there-opentype-sans-math-fonts-under-development\n\nFor consistent styling Fira Sans is included as well.\n\nDefault Fira Sans\n\nMath font extension\n\nWhat doesn't work\n\nContext styles and fonts\n\n- This syntax would be ideal, however, it doesn't work properly for fonts and there are no plans by mpl devs to fix this behaviour https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11673\n\nFor now one has to set the style globally:\n\nUse in publications\n\nUpdating list of citations and use cases of `mplhep` in publications:\n\n- And many others by now...",

  "usage_description": "This library is used to provide customized Matplotlib styles and plotting capabilities for High Energy Physics (HEP) applications, offering a set of default experiment labels that can be easily customized. With mplhep, developers can create publication-quality plots with HEP-specific styling and labeling options."
