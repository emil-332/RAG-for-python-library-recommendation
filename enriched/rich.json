Rich requires Python 3.8 or later.\n\nRich works with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with no additional configuration required.\n\nInstalling\n\nInstall with `pip` or your favorite PyPI package manager.\n\nRun the following to test Rich output on your terminal:\n\nRich Print\n\nTo effortlessly add rich output to your application, you can import the [rich print](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#quick-start) method, which has the same signature as the builtin Python function. Try this:\n\nRich REPL\n\nRich can be installed in the Python REPL, so that any data structures will be pretty printed and highlighted.\n\nUsing the Console\n\nFor more control over rich terminal content, import and construct a [Console](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/console.html#rich.console.Console) object.\n\nThe Console object has a `print` method which has an intentionally similar interface to the builtin `print` function. Here's an example of use:\n\nAs you might expect, this will print `\"Hello World!\"` to the terminal. Note that unlike the builtin `print` function, Rich will word-wrap your text to fit within the terminal width.\n\nThere are a few ways of adding color and style to your output. You can set a style for the entire output by adding a `style` keyword argument. Here's an example:\n\nThe output will be something like the following:\n\nThat's fine for styling a line of text at a time. For more finely grained styling, Rich renders a special markup which is similar in syntax to [bbcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode). Here's an example:\n\nYou can use a Console object to generate sophisticated output with minimal effort. See the [Console API](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/console.html) docs for details.\n\nRich Inspect\n\nRich has an [inspect](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/init.html?highlight=inspect#rich.inspect) function which can produce a report on any Python object, such as class, instance, or builtin.\n\nSee the [inspect docs](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/init.html#rich.inspect) for details.\n\nRich Library\n\nRich contains a number of builtin _renderables_ you can use to create elegant output in your CLI and help you debug your code.\n\nClick the following headings for details:\n\nLog\n\nThe Console object has a `log()` method which has a similar interface to `print()`, but also renders a column for the current time and the file and line which made the call. By default Rich will do syntax highlighting for Python structures and for repr strings. If you log a collection (i.e. a dict or a list) Rich will pretty print it so that it fits in the available space. Here's an example of some of these features.\n\nThe above produces the following output:\n\nNote the `log_locals` argument, which outputs a table containing the local variables where the log method was called.\n\nThe log method could be used for logging to the terminal for long running applications such as servers, but is also a very nice debugging aid.\n\nLogging Handler\n\nYou can also use the builtin [Handler class](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html) to format and colorize output from Python's logging module. Here's an example of the output:\n\nEmoji\n\nTo insert an emoji in to console output place the name between two colons. Here's an example:",

      "text": "Please use this feature wisely.\n\nTables\n\nRich can render flexible [tables](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tables.html) with unicode box characters. There is a large variety of formatting options for borders, styles, cell alignment etc.\n\nThe animation above was generated with [table_movie.py](https://github.com/textualize/rich/blob/master/examples/table_movie.py) in the examples directory.\n\nHere's a simpler table example:\n\nThis produces the following output:\n\nNote that console markup is rendered in the same way as `print()` and `log()`. In fact, anything that is renderable by Rich may be included in the headers / rows (even other tables).\n\nThe `Table` class is smart enough to resize columns to fit the available width of the terminal, wrapping text as required. Here's the same example, with the terminal made smaller than the table above:\n\nProgress Bars\n\nRich can render multiple flicker-free [progress](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/progress.html) bars to track long-running tasks.\n\nFor basic usage, wrap any sequence in the `track` function and iterate over the result. Here's an example:\n\nIt's not much harder to add multiple progress bars. Here's an example taken from the docs:\n\nThe columns may be configured to show any details you want. Built-in columns include percentage complete, file size, file speed, and time remaining. Here's another example showing a download in progress:\n\nTo try this out yourself, see [examples/downloader.py](https://github.com/textualize/rich/blob/master/examples/downloader.py) which can download multiple URLs simultaneously while displaying progress.\n\nStatus\n\nFor situations where it is hard to calculate progress, you can use the [status](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/console.html#rich.console.Console.status) method which will display a 'spinner' animation and message. The animation won't prevent you from using the console as normal. Here's an example:\n\nThis generates the following output in the terminal.\n\nThe spinner animations were borrowed from [cli-spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-spinners). You can select a spinner by specifying the `spinner` parameter. Run the following command to see the available values:\n\nThe above command generates the following output in the terminal:\n\nTree\n\nRich can render a [tree](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tree.html) with guide lines. A tree is ideal for displaying a file structure, or any other hierarchical data.\n\nThe labels of the tree can be simple text or anything else Rich can render. Run the following for a demonstration:\n\nThis generates the following output:\n\nSee the [tree.py](https://github.com/textualize/rich/blob/master/examples/tree.py) example for a script that displays a tree view of any directory, similar to the linux `tree` command.\n\nColumns\n\nRich can render content in neat [columns](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/columns.html) with equal or optimal width. Here's a very basic clone of the (MacOS / Linux) `ls` command which displays a directory listing in columns:\n\nThe following screenshot is the output from the [columns example](https://github.com/textualize/rich/blob/master/examples/columns.py) which displays data pulled from an API in columns:\n\nMarkdown\n\nRich can render [markdown](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markdown.html) and does a reasonable job of translating the formatting to the terminal.\n\nTo render markdown import the `Markdown` class and construct it with a string containing markdown code. Then print it to the console. Here's an example:\n\nThis will produce output something like the following:\n\nSyntax Highlighting\n\nRich uses the [pygments](https://pygments.org/) library to implement [syntax highlighting](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax.html). Usage is similar to rendering markdown; construct a `Syntax` object and print it to the console. Here's an example:\n\nThis will produce the following output:",

      "chunk_id": "rich::chunk_2",
      "text": "Tracebacks\n\nRich can render [beautiful tracebacks](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/traceback.html) which are easier to read and show more code than standard Python tracebacks. You can set Rich as the default traceback handler so all uncaught exceptions will be rendered by Rich.\n\nHere's what it looks like on OSX (similar on Linux):\n\nAll Rich renderables make use of the [Console Protocol](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html), which you can also use to implement your own Rich content.\n\nRich CLI\n\nSee also [Rich CLI](https://github.com/textualize/rich-cli) for a command line application powered by Rich. Syntax highlight code, render markdown, display CSVs in tables, and more, directly from the command prompt.\n\nTextual\n\nSee also Rich's sister project, [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual), which you can use to build sophisticated User Interfaces in the terminal.",
