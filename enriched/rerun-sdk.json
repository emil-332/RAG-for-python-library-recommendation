Data is streamed to the Rerun Viewer for live visualization or to file for later use.\n\nInstall\n\nℹ️ Note:\nThe Python module is called `rerun`, while the package published on PyPI is `rerun-sdk`.\n\nFor other SDK languages see [Installing Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/installing-viewer).\n\nWe also provide a [Jupyter widget](https://pypi.org/project/rerun-notebook/) for interactive data visualization in Jupyter notebooks:\n\nExample\n\nResources\n* [Examples](https://www.rerun.io/examples)\n* [Python API docs](https://ref.rerun.io/docs/python)\n* [Quick start](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/python)\n* [Tutorial](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/data-in/python)\n* [Troubleshooting](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting)\n* [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/Gcm8BbTaAj)\n\nLogging and viewing in different processes\n\nYou can run the Viewer and logger in different processes.\n\nIn one terminal, start up a Viewer with a server that the SDK can connect to:\n\nIn a second terminal, run the example with the `--connect` option:\n\nNote that SDK and Viewer can run on different machines!\n\nBuilding Rerun from source\n\nWe use the [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/) for managing dev-tool versioning, download and task running. See [here](https://github.com/casey/just#installation) for installation instructions.\n\nTo build SDK & Viewer for Python (or `pixi run py-build` for a debug build) and install it in the Pixi environment.\n\nYou can then run examples from the repository, either by making the Pixi shell active with `pixi shell -e py` and then running Python or by using `pixi run -e py`, e.g. `pixi run -e py python examples/python/minimal/minimal.py`.\n\nRespectively, to build a wheel instead for manual install use:\n\nRefer to [BUILD.md](../BUILD.md) for details on the various different build options of the Rerun Viewer and SDKs for all target languages.\n\nInstalling a pre-release\n\nPrebuilt dev wheels from head of main are available at .\n\nWhile we try to keep the main branch usable at all times, it may be unstable occasionally. Use at your own risk.\n\nRunning Python unit tests\n\nIf you run into a problem, run `rm -rf .pixi` and try again.\n\nRunning specific Python unit tests",

  "usage_description": "This library is used to record and stream data such as images, tensors, point clouds, and text for live visualization in the Rerun Viewer or offline analysis. With this library, developers can easily capture and log relevant data, enabling them to visualize and analyze it in real-time or later on."
