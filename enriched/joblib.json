See the\n  instructions in the `Building the docs`_ section for details.\n\nWorkflow to contribute\n======================\n\nTo contribute to joblib, first create an account on `github\n`_. Once this is done, fork the `joblib repository\n`_ to have your own repository,\nclone it using ``git clone``. Make your changes in a branch of your clone, push\nthem to your github account, test them locally, and when you are happy with\nthem, send a pull request to the main repository.\n\nYou can use `pre-commit `_ to run code style checks\nbefore each commit::\n\npre-commit checks can be disabled for a single commit with::\n\nRunning the test suite\n======================\n\nTo run the test suite, you need the pytest (version >= 3) and coverage modules.\nRun the test suite using::\n\nfrom the root of the project.\n\nBuilding the docs\n=================\n\nTo build the docs you need to have sphinx (>=1.4) and some dependencies\ninstalled::\n\nThe docs can then be built with the following command::\n\nThe html docs are located in the ``doc/_build/html`` directory.\n\nMaking a source tarball\n=======================\n\nTo create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run the\nfollowing command::\n\nThe tarball will be created in the `dist` directory. This command will create\nthe resulting tarball that can be installed with no extra dependencies than the\nPython standard library.\n\nMaking a release and uploading it to PyPI\n=========================================\n\nThis command is only run by project manager, to make a release, and\nupload in to PyPI::\n\nNote that the documentation should automatically get updated at each git\npush. If that is not the case, try building th doc locally and resolve\nany doc build error (in particular when running the examples).\n\nUpdating the changelog\n======================\n\nChanges are listed in the CHANGES.rst file. They must be manually updated\nbut, the following git command may be used to generate the lines::",

  "usage_description": "This library is used to simplify the process of creating and managing complex data processing pipelines with Python functions, allowing developers to efficiently combine and parallelize multiple tasks. With joblib, developers can streamline their workflows by leveraging a lightweight pipelining framework that provides a convenient way to compose and execute sequences of function calls in parallel or sequentially."
