It is especially intended for performing geometric calculations on _arrays of vectors_, rather than one vector at a time in a Python for loop.\n\nVector is part of the [Scikit-HEP project](https://scikit-hep.org/), High Energy Physics (HEP) tools in Python.\n\nCoordinate systems\n\nVectors may be expressed in any of these coordinate systems:\n\n- the azimuthal plane may be Cartesian `x` `y` or polar `rho` ($\\rho$) `phi` ($\\phi$)\n- the longitudinal axis may be Cartesian `z`, polar `theta` ($\\theta$), or pseudorapidity `eta` ($\\eta$)\n- the temporal component for space-time vectors may be Cartesian `t` or proper time `tau` ($\\tau$)\n\nin any combination. (That is, 4D vectors have 2×3×2 = 12 distinct coordinate systems.)\n\nBackends\n\nVectors may be included in any of these data types:\n\nEach of these \"backends\" provides the same suite of properties and methods, through a common \"compute\" library.\n\nIntegrations\n\nOptionally, the vector package provides integration with other libraries. Currently, this includes:\n\n- [PyTree integrations](https://vector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/pytree.html) using the [optree](https://github.com/metaopt/optree) package.\n\nGeometric versus momentum\n\nFinally, vectors come in two flavors:\n\n- geometric: only one name for each property or method\n- momentum: same property or method can be accessed with several synonyms, such as `pt` ($p_T$, transverse momentum) for the azimuthal magnitude `rho` ($\\rho$) and `energy` and `mass` for the Cartesian time `t` and proper time `tau` ($\\tau$).\n\nFamiliar conventions\n\nNames and coordinate conventions were chosen to align with [ROOT](https://root.cern/)'s [TLorentzVector](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTLorentzVector.html) and [Math::LorentzVector](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classROOT_1_1Math_1_1LorentzVector.html), as well as [scikit-hep/math](https://github.com/scikit-hep/scikit-hep/tree/master/skhep/math), [uproot-methods TLorentzVector](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot3-methods/blob/master/uproot3_methods/classes/TLorentzVector.py), [henryiii/hepvector](https://github.com/henryiii/hepvector), and [coffea.nanoevents.methods.vector](https://coffea-hep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/coffea.nanoevents.methods.vector.html).\n\nGetting help\n\nContributing to Vector\n\nIf you want to contribute to Vector, [pull requests](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector/pulls) are welcome!\n\nPlease install the latest version of the `main` branch from source or a fork:\n\nRefer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.\n\nCiting Vector\n\nDocumentation\n\nTutorials\n\nVector constructors\n\nVector functions\n\nIntegrations\n\n- [PyTree integration API](https://vector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/pytree_api.html)\n\nMore ways to learn\n\n- [Papers and talks](https://vector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/talks.html)\n\nContributors\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n  \n  \n\nThis project follows the\n[all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors)\nspecification.
