      "text": "Pydot\n\n`pydot` is a Python interface to Graphviz and its DOT language. You can use `pydot` to create, read, edit, and visualize graphs.\n\n- It's made in pure Python, with only one dependency – pyparsing – other than Graphviz itself.\n- It's compatible with `networkx`, which can convert its graphs to `pydot`.\n\nTo see what Graphviz is capable of, check the [Graphviz Gallery](https://graphviz.org/gallery/)!\n\nDependencies\n\n- Python: The latest version of pydot supports Python 3.9+. It may work with Python 3.6-3.8, but we can't guarantee full support. If you're using one of these older versions, feel free to experiment, but we won't be able to address issues specific to them. Older versions of pydot are also an option.\n- [`pyparsing`][pyparsing]: used only for *loading* DOT files, installed automatically during `pydot` installation.\n- GraphViz: used to render graphs in a variety of formats, including PNG, SVG, PDF, and more.\n  Should be installed separately, using your system's [package manager][pkg], something similar (e.g., [MacPorts][mac]), or from [its source][src].\n\nInstallation\n\n- Latest release, from [PyPI][pypi]:\n\n  \n\n- Current development code, from this repository:\n\n  \n\n- Development installation, to modify the code or contribute changes:\n\nQuickstart\n\n1. Input\n\nNo matter what you want to do with `pydot`, you'll need some input to start with. Here are the common ways to get some data to work with.\n\nImport a graph from an existing DOT file\n\nLet's say you already have a file `example.dot` (based on an [example from Wikipedia][wiki_example]):\n\nYou can read the graph from the file in this way:\n\nParse a graph from an existing DOT string\n\nUse this method if you already have a string describing a DOT graph:\n\nCreate a graph from scratch using pydot objects\n\nThis is where the cool stuff starts. Use this method if you want to build new graphs with Python code.\n\nYou can use these basic building blocks in your Python program\nto dynamically generate a graph. For example, start with a\nbasic `pydot.Dot` graph object, then loop through your data\nas you add nodes and edges. Use values from your data as labels to\ndetermine shapes, edges and so on. This allows you to easily create\nvisualizations of thousands of related objects.\n\nConvert a NetworkX graph to a pydot graph\n\nNetworkX has conversion methods for pydot graphs:\n\n2. Edit\n\nYou can now further manipulate your graph using pydot methods:\n\nAdd more nodes and edges:\n\nEdit attributes of graphs, nodes and edges:\n\n3. Output\n\nHere are three different output options:\n\nGenerate an image\n\nIf you just want to save the image to a file, use one of the `write_*` methods:\n\nIf you need to further process the image output, the `create_*` methods will get you a Python `bytes` object:\n\nRetrieve the DOT string\n\nThere are two different DOT strings you can retrieve:\n\n- The \"raw\" pydot DOT: This is generated the fastest and will\n  usually still look quite similar to the DOT you put in. It is\n  generated by pydot itself, without calling Graphviz.\n\n  \n\n- The Graphviz DOT: You can use it to check how Graphviz lays out\n  the graph before it produces an image. It is generated by\n  Graphviz.\n\nConvert to a NetworkX graph\n\nNetworkX has a conversion method for pydot graphs:\n\nMore help\n\nFor more help, see the docstrings of the various pydot objects and\nmethods. For example, `help(pydot)`, `help(pydot.Graph)` and\n`help(pydot.Dot.write)`.\n\nMore [documentation contributions welcome][contrib].\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nEnable logging\n\n`pydot` uses Python's standard `logging` module. To see the logs,\nassuming logging has not been configured already:\n\n**Warning**: When `DEBUG` level logging is enabled, `pydot` may log the\ndata that it processes, such as graph contents or DOT strings. This can\ncause the log to become very large or contain sensitive information.\n\nAdvanced logging configuration\n\n- Check out the [Python logging documentation][log] and the\n  [`logging_tree`][log_tree] visualizer.\n- `pydot` does not add any handlers to its loggers, nor does it setup\n  or modify your root logger. The `pydot` loggers are created with the\n  default level `NOTSET`.\n- `pydot` registers the following loggers:\n  - `pydot`: Parent logger. Emits a few messages during startup.\n  - `pydot.core`: Messages related to pydot objects, Graphviz execution\n  - `pydot.dot_parser`: Messages related to the parsing of DOT strings.\n\nLicense\n\nDistributed under the [MIT license][MIT].\n\nThe module [`pydot._vendor.tempfile`][tempfile]\nis based on the Python 3.12 standard library module\n[`tempfile.py`][tempfile-src],\nCopyright © 2001-2023 Python Software Foundation.

  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to create, read, edit, and visualize graphs in Python, leveraging the power of Graphviz's DOT language. With pydot, developers can build and manipulate complex graph structures, making it ideal for tasks like network visualization, algorithmic analysis, and data exploration."
