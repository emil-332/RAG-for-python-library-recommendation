      "text": "Param\n\n**Param** is a zero-dependency Python library that provides two main features:\n\n- Easily create classes with **rich, declarative attributes** - `Parameter` objects - that include extended metadata for various purposes such as runtime type and range validation, documentation strings, default values or factories, nullability, etc. In this sense, Param is conceptually similar to libraries like Pydantic, Python's dataclasses, or Traitlets.\n- A suite of expressive and composable APIs for **reactive programming**, enabling automatic updates on attribute changes, and declaring complex reactive dependencies and expressions that can be introspected by other frameworks to implement their own reactive workflows.\n\nThis combination of **rich attributes** and **reactive APIs** makes Param a solid foundation for constructing user interfaces, graphical applications, and responsive systems where data integrity and automatic synchronization are paramount. In fact, Param serves as the backbone of HoloViz’s [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) and [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org) libraries, powering their rich interactivity and data-driven workflows.\n\nHere is a very simple example showing both features at play. We declare a UserForm class with three parameters: `age` as an *Integer* parameter and and `name` as a *String* parameter for user data, and `submit` as an *Event* parameter to simulate a button in a user interface. We also declare that the `save_user_to_db` method should be called automatically when the value of the `submit` attribute changes.\n\n---\n\nEnjoying Param?

Once you have done that, Param can handle runtime attribute validation (type checking, range validation, etc.) and more (documentation, serialization, etc.). Let's see how to use `Parameter` objects with a simple example, a `Processor` class that has three attributes.\n\nRuntime attribute validation is a great feature that helps build defendable code bases! Alternative libraries, like [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) and others, excel at input validation, and if this is only what you need, you should probably look into them. Where Param shines is when you also need:\n\n- Attributes that are also available at the class level, allowing to easily configure a hierarchy of classes and their instances.\n- Parameters with rich metadata (`default`, `doc`, `label`, `bounds`, etc.) that downstream tooling can inspect to build configuration UIs, CLIs, or documentation automatically.\n- Parameterized subclasses that inherit Parameter metadata from their parents, and can selectively override certain attributes (e.g. overriding `default` in a subclass).\n\nLet's see this in action by extending the example above with a custom processor subclass:\n\nReactive Programming\n\nParam extends beyond rich class attributes with a suite of APIs for reactive programming. Let's do a quick tour!\n\nWe'll start with APIs that trigger side-effects only, which either have the noun watch in their name or are invoked with `watch=True`:",

      "text": "1. `.param.watch(fn, *parameters, ...)`: Low-level, imperative API to attach callbacks to parameter changes, the callback receives one or more rich `Event` objects.\n2. `@depends(*parameter_names, watch=True)`: In a Parameterized class, declare dependencies and automatically watch parameters for changes to call the decorated method.\n3. `bind(fn, *references, watch=True, **kwargs)`: Function binding with automatic references (parameters, bound functions, reactive expressions) watching and triggering on changes.\n\nLet's continue the tour with what we'll call \"reactive APIs\". Contrary to the APIs presented above, in this group parameter updates do not immediately trigger side effects. Instead, these APIs let you declare relationships, dependencies, and expressions, which can be introspected by other frameworks to set up their own reactive workflows.\n\n1. `@depends(*parameter_names)`: In a Parameterized class, declare parameter dependencies by decorating a method.\n2. `bind(fn, *references, **kwargs)`: Create a bound function, that when called, will always use the current parameter/reference value. `bind` is essentially a reactive version of [`functools.partial`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial).\n3. `rx()`: Fluent API to create reactive expressions, which allow chaining and composing operations.\n\n`rx()` is the highest-level reactive API Param offers. We'll show a simple example first, using literal values as input of three source reactive expressions, that we combine with simple arithmetic operations.\n\nThe snippet below shows a slightly more complex example that reveals the power of reactive expressions.\n\nA `Parameter` does not have to refer to a specific static value but can reference another object and update reactively when its value changes. We'll show a few examples of supported *references* (Parameters, bound functions, reactive expressions, etc.). Setting parameter values with references is an effective way to establish automatic one-way linking between a reference and a parameter (the reference being often driven by another parameter).\n\nSupport & Feedback\n\nFor more detail check out the [HoloViz Community Guide](https://holoviz.org/community.html).\n\nContributing\n\nCheck out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.MD).\n\nLicense\n\nParam is completely free and open-source.
