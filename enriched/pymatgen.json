      "text": "Why use `pymatgen`?\n\n1. **It is (fairly) robust.** Pymatgen is used by thousands of researchers and is the analysis code powering the\n   [Materials Project]. The analysis it produces survives rigorous scrutiny every single day. Bugs tend to be found\n   and corrected quickly. Pymatgen also uses Github Actions for continuous integration, which ensures that every\n   new code passes a comprehensive suite of unit tests.\n2. **It is well documented.** A fairly comprehensive documentation has been written to help you get to grips with\n   it quickly.\n3. **It is open.** You are free to use and contribute to `pymatgen`. It also means that `pymatgen` is continuously\n   being improved. We will attribute any code you contribute to any publication you specify. Contributing to\n   `pymatgen` means your research becomes more visible, which translates to greater impact.\n4. **It is fast.** Many of the core numerical methods in `pymatgen` have been optimized by vectorizing in\n   `numpy`/`scipy`. This means that coordinate manipulations are fast. Pymatgen also comes with a complete system\n   for handling periodic boundary conditions.\n5. **It will be around.** Pymatgen is not a pet research project. It is used in the well-established Materials\n   Project. It is also actively being developed and maintained by the [Materials Virtual Lab], the ABINIT group and\n   many other research groups.\n6. **A growing ecosystem of developers and add-ons**. Pymatgen has contributions from materials scientists all over\n   the world. We also now have an architecture to support add-ons that expand `pymatgen`'s functionality even\n   further. Check out the [contributing page](https://pymatgen.org/contributing) and [add-ons page](https://pymatgen.org/addons) for details and examples.\n\nInstallation\n\nThe version at the Python Package Index [PyPI] is always the latest stable release that is relatively bug-free and can be installed via `pip`:\n\nIf you'd like to use the latest unreleased changes on the main branch, you can install directly from GitHub:\n\nSome extra functionality (e.g., generation of POTCARs) does require additional setup (see the [`pymatgen` docs]).\n\nChange Log\n\nSee [GitHub releases](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/releases), [`docs/CHANGES.md`](docs/CHANGES.md) or [commit history](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/commits/master) in increasing order of details.\n\nUsing pymatgen\n\nPlease refer to the official [`pymatgen` docs] for tutorials and examples. Dr Anubhav Jain (@computron) has also created\na series of [tutorials](https://github.com/computron/pymatgen_tutorials) and [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7gkuUui8u7_M47KrV4tS4pLwhe7mDAjT), which is a good resource, especially for beginners.\n\nHow to cite pymatgen\n\nIf you use `pymatgen` in your research, please consider citing the following [work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2012.10.028):\n\nIn addition, some of `pymatgen`'s functionality is based on scientific advances/principles developed by the\ncomputational materials scientists in our team. Please refer to the [`pymatgen` docs] on how to cite them.\n\nLicense\n\nPymatgen is released under the MIT License. The terms of the license are as follows:\n\nAbout the Pymatgen Development Team\n\nShyue Ping Ong (@shyuep) of the [Materials Virtual Lab] started Pymatgen in 2011 and is still the project lead.\nJanosh Riebesell (@janosh) and Matthew Horton (@mkhorton) are co-maintainers.\n\nThe [`pymatgen` development team] is the set of all contributors to the `pymatgen` project, including all subprojects.\n\nOur Copyright Policy\n\nPymatgen uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to `pymatgen`.\nBut, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the\n`pymatgen` source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the\ncollective copyright of the entire [`pymatgen` Development Team]. If individual contributors want to maintain a\nrecord of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the\ncommit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the `pymatgen` repositories.",
