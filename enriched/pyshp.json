The Shapefile format is a popular Geographic\nInformation System vector data format created by Esri. For more information\nabout this format please read the well-written \"ESRI Shapefile Technical\nDescription - July 1998\" located at [http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/p\ndfs/shapefile.pdf](http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf)\n. The Esri document describes the shp and shx file formats. However a third\nfile format called dbf is also required. This format is documented on the web\nas the \"XBase File Format Description\" and is a simple file-based database\nformat created in the 1960's. For more on this specification see: [http://www.clicketyclick.dk/databases/xbase/format/index.html](http://www.clicketyclick.dk/databases/xbase/format/index.html)\n\nBoth the Esri and XBase file-formats are very simple in design and memory\nefficient which is part of the reason the shapefile format remains popular\ndespite the numerous ways to store and exchange GIS data available today.\n\nThis document provides examples for using PyShp to read and write shapefiles. However\nmany more examples are continually added to the blog [http://GeospatialPython.com](http://GeospatialPython.com),\nand by searching for PyShp on [https://gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com).\n\nCurrently the sample census blockgroup shapefile referenced in the examples is available on the GitHub project site at\n[https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp](https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp). These\nexamples are straight-forward and you can also easily run them against your\nown shapefiles with minimal modification.\n\nImportant: If you are new to GIS you should read about map projections.\nPlease visit: [https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp/wiki/Map-Projections](https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp/wiki/Map-Projections)\n\nI sincerely hope this library eliminates the mundane distraction of simply\nreading and writing data, and allows you to focus on the challenging and FUN\npart of your geospatial project.\n\nVersion Changes\n\n3.0.3\n\nType checking\n- Add optional dependency, \"stubs\", containing the package \"pyshp-stubs\" generated with stubgen (to avoid\nincluding py.typed, and no longer being a single file project).\n\nBug fix\n- Prevented UnboundLocalError when reading non-single point M and Z type Shapefiles (@ekawas-vrify).",

Including the py.typed marker file with a single file package caused type checkers to type check all other libraries installed in the same directory (whether they're typed or not, enforcing type checking for all the adjacent dirs libraries, regardless of the user's intentions for the type checker) (pointed out by @dl1jbe - thanks Thomas).  Discussions will be started about a longer term fix, possibly e.g. possibly refactoring to a package, and restoring py.typed.\n\nCode quality:\n- Ruff check's UP rule added (mimicks PyUpgrade) (@mwtoews).\n\n3.0.1\n\nImprovements\n- Reader(shp=, dbf=, shx=) now support pathlib.Paths, and any pathlike object (@mwtoews).\n\nBug fixes\n- PyShp 3 no longer modifies the global doctest module (@JamesParrott).\n\nCode quality\n- isort replaced by Ruff check's I rule (@mwtoews).\n- mypy --strict used in CI (@JamesParrott).\n- LICENSE.TXT re-encoded in UTF-8 (@musicinmybrain).\n\n3.0.0\n\nBreaking Changes:\n- Python 2 and Python 3.8 support dropped.\n- Field info tuple is now a namedtuple (Field) instead of a list.\n- Field type codes are now FieldType 'enum' members.\n- bbox, mbox and zbox attributes are all new Namedtuples.\n- Writer does not mutate Shapes.\n- New custom subclasses for each shape type: Null, Multipatch, Point, Polyline,\n  Multipoint, and Polygon, plus the latter 4's M and Z variants (Reader and\n  Writer are still compatible with their base class, Shape, as before).\n- Shape sub classes are creatable from, and serializable to bytes streams,\n  as per the shapefile spec.\n\nImprovements:\n- Speeded up writing shapefiles by up to another ~27% (on top of the recent ~39% improvement in 2.4.1).\n\nCode quality\n- Statically typed, and checked with Mypy\n- Checked with Ruff.\n- f-strings\n- Remove Python 2 specific functions.\n- Run doctests against wheels.\n- Testing of wheels before publishing them\n- pyproject.toml src layout\n- Slow test marked.\n\n2.4.1\n\nImprovements:\n- Speed up writing shapefiles by up to ~39%.  Combined for loops of calls to f.write(pack(...)), into single calls.\n\nBreaking Change.  Support for Python 2 and Pythons = 3.9).\n- This will not break any projects, as pip and other package managers should not install PyShp 3.0.0\n(after its release) in unsupported Pythons.  But we no longer promise such projects will get PyShp's latest\nbug fixes and features.\n- If this negatively impacts your project, all feedback about this decision is welcome\non our [the discussion page](https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp/discussions/290).\n\n2.4.0\n\nNew Features:\n- Reader.iterRecords now allows start and stop to be specified, to lookup smaller ranges of records.\n- Equality comparisons between Records now also require the fields to be the same (and in the same order).",

      "text": "The examples below will use a shapefile created from the U.S. Census Bureau\nBlockgroups data set near San Francisco, CA and available in the git\nrepository of the PyShp GitHub site.\n\nReading Shapefiles\n\nThe Reader Class\n\nReading Shapefiles from Local Files\n\nTo read a shapefile create a new \"Reader\" object and pass it the name of an\nexisting shapefile. The shapefile format is actually a collection of three\nfiles. You specify the base filename of the shapefile or the complete filename\nof any of the shapefile component files.\n\n>>> sf = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/blockgroups\")\n\nOR\n\n>>> sf = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/blockgroups.shp\")\n\nOR\n\n>>> sf = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/blockgroups.dbf\")\n\nOR any of the other 5+ formats which are potentially part of a shapefile. The\nlibrary does not care about file extensions. You can also specify that you only\nwant to read some of the file extensions through the use of keyword arguments:\n\n>>> sf = shapefile.Reader(dbf=\"shapefiles/blockgroups.dbf\")\n\nReading Shapefiles from Zip Files\n\nIf your shapefile is wrapped inside a zip file, the library is able to handle that too, meaning you don't have to worry about unzipping the contents:\n\n>>> sf = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/blockgroups.zip\")\n\nIf the zip file contains multiple shapefiles, just specify which shapefile to read by additionally specifying the relative path after the \".zip\" part:\n\n>>> sf = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/blockgroups_multishapefile.zip/blockgroups2.shp\")\n\nReading Shapefiles from URLs\n\nFinally, you can use all of the above methods to read shapefiles directly from the internet, by giving a url instead of a local path, e.g.:\n\n>>> # from a zipped shapefile on website\n\t>>> sf = shapefile.Reader(\"https://github.com/JamesParrott/PyShp_test_shapefile/raw/main/gis_osm_natural_a_free_1.zip\")\n\n>>> # from a shapefile collection of files in a github repository\n\t>>> sf = shapefile.Reader(\"https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/master/110m_cultural/ne_110m_admin_0_tiny_countries.shp?raw=true\")\n\nThis will automatically download the file(s) to a temporary location before reading, saving you a lot of time and repetitive boilerplate code when you just want quick access to some external data.\n\nReading Shapefiles from File-Like Objects\n\nYou can also load shapefiles from any Python file-like object using keyword\narguments to specify any of the three files. This feature is very powerful and\nallows you to custom load shapefiles from arbitrary storage formats, such as a protected url or zip file, a serialized object, or in some cases a database.\n\n>>> myshp = open(\"shapefiles/blockgroups.shp\", \"rb\")\n\t>>> mydbf = open(\"shapefiles/blockgroups.dbf\", \"rb\")\n\t>>> r = shapefile.Reader(shp=myshp, dbf=mydbf)\n\nNotice in the examples above the shx file is never used. The shx file is a\nvery simple fixed-record index for the variable-length records in the shp\nfile. This file is optional for reading. If it's available PyShp will use the\nshx file to access shape records a little faster but will do just fine without\nit.\n\nReading Shapefiles Using the Context Manager\n\nThe \"Reader\" class can be used as a context manager, to ensure open file\nobjects are properly closed when done reading the data:\n\nReading Shapefile Meta-Data\n\nShapefiles have a number of attributes for inspecting the file contents.\nA shapefile is a container for a specific type of geometry, and this can be checked using the\nshapeType attribute.",

It is important to note that the numbering system has\nseveral reserved numbers that have not been used yet, therefore the numbers of\nthe existing shape types are not sequential:\n\n- NULL = 0\n- POINT = 1\n- POLYLINE = 3\n- POLYGON = 5\n- MULTIPOINT = 8\n- POINTZ = 11\n- POLYLINEZ = 13\n- POLYGONZ = 15\n- MULTIPOINTZ = 18\n- POINTM = 21\n- POLYLINEM = 23\n- POLYGONM = 25\n- MULTIPOINTM = 28\n- MULTIPATCH = 31\n\nBased on this we can see that our blockgroups shapefile contains\nPolygon type shapes. The shape types are also defined as constants in\nthe shapefile module, so that we can compare types more intuitively:\n\n>>> sf.shapeType == shapefile.POLYGON\n\tTrue\n\nFor convenience, you can also get the name of the shape type as a string:\n\n>>> sf.shapeTypeName == 'POLYGON'\n\tTrue\n\nOther pieces of meta-data that we can check include the number of features\nand the bounding box area the shapefile covers:\n\n>>> len(sf)\n\t663\n\t>>> sf.bbox\n\t(-122.515048, 37.652916, -122.327622, 37.863433)\n\nFinally, if you would prefer to work with the entire shapefile in a different\nformat, you can convert all of it to a GeoJSON dictionary, although you may lose\nsome information in the process, such as z- and m-values:\n\n>>> sf.__geo_interface__['type']\n\t'FeatureCollection'\n\nReading Geometry\n\nA shapefile's geometry is the collection of points or shapes made from\nvertices and implied arcs representing physical locations. All types of\nshapefiles just store points. The metadata about the points determine how they\nare handled by software.\n\nYou can get a list of the shapefile's geometry by calling the shapes()\nmethod.\n\n>>> shapes = sf.shapes()\n\nThe shapes method returns a list of Shape objects describing the geometry of\neach shape record.\n\n>>> len(shapes)\n\t663\n\nTo read a single shape by calling its index use the shape() method. The index\nis the shape's count from 0. So to read the 8th shape record you would use its\nindex which is 7.\n\n>>> s = sf.shape(7)\n\t>>> s\n\tPolygon #7\n\n>>> # Read the bbox of the 8th shape to verify\n\t>>> # Round coordinates to 3 decimal places\n\t>>> ['%.3f' % coord for coord in s.bbox]\n\t['-122.450', '37.801', '-122.442', '37.808']\n\nEach shape record (except Points) contains the following attributes.

This way if you forget to update an entry the\nshapefile will still be valid and handled correctly by most shapefile\nsoftware. Autobalancing is NOT turned on by default.

If you don't have one, you may get confusing errors when you try and use the shapefile you created. The GIS software may complain that it doesn't know the shapefile's projection and refuse to accept it, it may assume the shapefile is the same projection as the rest of your GIS project and put it in the wrong place, or it might assume the coordinates are an offset in meters from latitude and longitude 0,0 which will put your data in the middle of the ocean near Africa. The text in the .prj file is a [Well-Known-Text (WKT) projection string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_coordinate_reference_systems). Projection strings can be quite long so they are often referenced using numeric codes call EPSG codes. The .prj file must have the same base name as your shapefile.

So another way to suppress all PyShp warnings would be to alter the logging behavior for that namespace:\n\n>>> import logging\n\t>>> logging.getLogger('shapefile').setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n\nShapefile Encoding Errors\n\nPyShp supports reading and writing shapefiles in any language or character encoding, and provides several options for decoding and encoding text.\nMost shapefiles are written in UTF-8 encoding, PyShp's default encoding, so in most cases you don't have to specify the encoding.\nIf you encounter an encoding error when reading a shapefile, this means the shapefile was likely written in a non-utf8 encoding.\nFor instance, when working with English language shapefiles, a common reason for encoding errors is that the shapefile was written in Latin-1 encoding.\nFor reading shapefiles in any non-utf8 encoding, such as Latin-1, just\nsupply the encoding option when creating the Reader class.\n\n>>> r = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/test/latin1.shp\", encoding=\"latin1\")\n\t>>> r.record(0) == [2, u'Ñandú']\n\tTrue\n\nOnce you have loaded the shapefile, you may choose to save it using another more supportive encoding such\nas UTF-8. Assuming the new encoding supports the characters you are trying to write, reading it back in\nshould give you the same unicode string you started with.\n\n>>> w = shapefile.Writer(\"shapefiles/test/latin_as_utf8.shp\", encoding=\"utf8\")\n\t>>> w.fields = r.fields[1:]\n\t>>> w.record(*r.record(0))\n\t>>> w.null()\n\t>>> w.close()\n\n>>> r = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/test/latin_as_utf8.shp\", encoding=\"utf8\")\n\t>>> r.record(0) == [2, u'Ñandú']\n\tTrue\n\nIf you supply the wrong encoding and the string is unable to be decoded, PyShp will by default raise an\nexception. If however, on rare occasion, you are unable to find the correct encoding and want to ignore\nor replace encoding errors, you can specify the \"encodingErrors\" to be used by the decode method. This\napplies to both reading and writing.\n\n>>> r = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/test/latin1.shp\", encoding=\"ascii\", encodingErrors=\"replace\")\n\t>>> r.record(0) == [2, u'�and�']\n\tTrue\n\nReading Large Shapefiles\n\nDespite being a lightweight library, PyShp is designed to be able to read shapefiles of any size, allowing you to work with hundreds of thousands or even millions\nof records and complex geometries.\n\nIterating through a shapefile\n\nAs an example, let's load this Natural Earth shapefile of more than 4000 global administrative boundary polygons:\n\n>>> sf = shapefile.Reader(\"https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/master/10m_cultural/ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces?raw=true\")",

      "text": "When first creating the Reader class, the library only reads the header information\nand leaves the rest of the file contents alone. Once you call the records() and shapes()\nmethods however, it will attempt to read the entire file into memory at once.\nFor very large files this can result in MemoryError. So when working with large files\nit is recommended to use instead the iterShapes(), iterRecords(), or iterShapeRecords()\nmethods instead. These iterate through the file contents one at a time, enabling you to loop\nthrough them while keeping memory usage at a minimum.\n\n>>> for shape in sf.iterShapes():\n\t...     # do something here\n\t...     pass\n\n>>> for rec in sf.iterRecords():\n\t...     # do something here\n\t...     pass\n\n>>> for shapeRec in sf.iterShapeRecords():\n\t...     # do something here\n\t...     pass\n\n>>> for shapeRec in sf: # same as iterShapeRecords()\n\t...     # do something here\n\t...     pass\n\nLimiting which fields to read\n\nBy default when reading the attribute records of a shapefile, pyshp unpacks and returns the data for all of the dbf fields, regardless of whether you actually need that data or not. To limit which field data is unpacked when reading each record and speed up processing time, you can specify the `fields` argument to any of the methods involving record data. Note that the order of the specified fields does not matter, the resulting records will list the specified field values in the order that they appear in the original dbf file. For instance, if we are only interested in the country and name of each admin unit, the following is a more efficient way of iterating through the file:\n\n>>> fields = [\"geonunit\", \"name\"]\n\t>>> for rec in sf.iterRecords(fields=fields):\n\t... \t# do something\n\t... \tpass\n\t>>> rec\n\tRecord #4595: ['Birgu', 'Malta']\n\nAttribute filtering\n\nIn many cases, we aren't interested in all entries of a shapefile, but rather only want to retrieve a small subset of records by filtering on some attribute. To avoid wasting time reading records and shapes that we don't need, we can start by iterating only the records and fields of interest, check if the record matches some condition as a way to filter the data, and finally load the full record and shape geometry for those that meet the condition:\n\n>>> filter_field = \"geonunit\"\n\t>>> filter_value = \"Eritrea\"\n\t>>> for rec in sf.iterRecords(fields=[filter_field]):\n\t...     if rec[filter_field] == filter_value:\n\t... \t\t# load full record and shape\n\t... \t\tshapeRec = sf.shapeRecord(rec.oid)\n\t... \t\tshapeRec.record[\"name\"]\n\t'Debubawi Keyih Bahri'\n\t'Debub'\n\t'Semenawi Keyih Bahri'\n\t'Gash Barka'\n\t'Maekel'\n\t'Anseba'\n\nSelectively reading only the necessary data in this way is particularly useful for efficiently processing a limited subset of data from very large files or when looping through a large number of files, especially if they contain large attribute tables or complex shape geometries.\n\nSpatial filtering",

      "text": "Another common use-case is that we only want to read those records that are located in some region of interest. Because the shapefile stores the bounding box of each shape separately from the geometry data, it's possible to quickly retrieve all shapes that might overlap a given bounding box region without having to load the full shape geometry data for every shape. This can be done by specifying the `bbox` argument to the shapes, iterShapes, or iterShapeRecords methods:\n\n>>> bbox = [36.423, 12.360, 43.123, 18.004] # ca bbox of Eritrea\n\t>>> fields = [\"geonunit\",\"name\"]\n\t>>> for shapeRec in sf.iterShapeRecords(bbox=bbox, fields=fields):\n\t... \tshapeRec.record\n\tRecord #368: ['Afar', 'Ethiopia']\n\tRecord #369: ['Tadjourah', 'Djibouti']\n\tRecord #375: ['Obock', 'Djibouti']\n\tRecord #376: ['Debubawi Keyih Bahri', 'Eritrea']\n\tRecord #1106: ['Amhara', 'Ethiopia']\n\tRecord #1107: ['Gedarif', 'Sudan']\n\tRecord #1108: ['Tigray', 'Ethiopia']\n\tRecord #1414: ['Sa`dah', 'Yemen']\n\tRecord #1415: ['`Asir', 'Saudi Arabia']\n\tRecord #1416: ['Hajjah', 'Yemen']\n\tRecord #1417: ['Jizan', 'Saudi Arabia']\n\tRecord #1598: ['Debub', 'Eritrea']\n\tRecord #1599: ['Red Sea', 'Sudan']\n\tRecord #1600: ['Semenawi Keyih Bahri', 'Eritrea']\n\tRecord #1601: ['Gash Barka', 'Eritrea']\n\tRecord #1602: ['Kassala', 'Sudan']\n\tRecord #1603: ['Maekel', 'Eritrea']\n\tRecord #2037: ['Al Hudaydah', 'Yemen']\n\tRecord #3741: ['Anseba', 'Eritrea']\n\nThis functionality means that shapefiles can be used as a bare-bones spatially indexed database, with very fast bounding box queries for even the largest of shapefiles. Note that, as with all spatial indexing, this method does not guarantee that the *geometries* of the resulting matches overlap the queried region, only that their *bounding boxes* overlap.\n\nWriting large shapefiles\n\nSimilar to the Reader class, the shapefile Writer class uses a streaming approach to keep memory\nusage at a minimum and allow writing shapefiles of arbitrarily large sizes. The library takes care of this under-the-hood by immediately\nwriting each geometry and record to disk the moment they\nare added using shape() or record(). Once the writer is closed, exited, or garbage\ncollected, the final header information is calculated and written to the beginning of\nthe file.\n\nMerging multiple shapefiles\n\nThis means that it's possible to merge hundreds or thousands of shapefiles, as\nlong as you iterate through the source files to avoid loading everything into\nmemory. The following example copies the contents of a shapefile to a new file 10 times:\n\n>>> # create writer\n\t>>> w = shapefile.Writer('shapefiles/test/merge')\n\n>>> # copy over fields from the reader\n\t>>> r = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/blockgroups\")\n\t>>> for field in r.fields[1:]:\n\t...     w.field(*field)\n\n>>> # copy the shapefile to writer 10 times\n\t>>> repeat = 10\n\t>>> for i in range(repeat):\n\t...     r = shapefile.Reader(\"shapefiles/blockgroups\")\n\t...     for shapeRec in r.iterShapeRecords():\n\t...         w.record(*shapeRec.record)\n\t...         w.shape(shapeRec.shape)\n\n>>> # check that the written file is 10 times longer\n\t>>> len(w) == len(r) * 10\n\tTrue\n\n>>> # close the writer\n\t>>> w.close()\n\nIn this trivial example, we knew that all files had the exact same field names, ordering, and types. In other scenarios, you will have to additionally make sure that all shapefiles have the exact same fields in the same order, and that they all contain the same geometry type.\n\nEditing shapefiles",

Z-values do not support the concept of missing data,\nbut if you omit the third Z-coordinate it will default to 0. Note that Z-type shapes also support measurement (M) values added\nas a fourth M-coordinate.
