This is normal operation.  \n(ex. [0, 0, 0, 186, 186, 166, 186, 186, 168, ...])\n\n [More code examples](https://dofuuz.github.io/dsp/2024/05/26/sample-rate-conversion-in-python.html)\n\nBenchmark\n\nSweep, impulse, speed compairsion with other resamplers for Python.\n\nSpeed comparison summary\n\nDownsampling 10 sec of 48000 Hz to 44100 Hz.  \nRan on Google Colab.\n\nLibrary                  | Time on CPU (ms)\n------------------------ | ----------------\nsoxr (HQ)                | 10.8\ntorchaudio               | 13.8\nsoxr (VHQ)               | 14.5\nscipy.signal.resample    | 21.3\nlilfilter                | 24.7\njulius                   | 31\nresampy (kaiser_fast)    | 108\nsamplerate (sinc_medium) | 223\nresampy (kaiser_best)    | 310\nsamplerate (sinc_best)   | 794\n\nTechnical detail\n\nFor technical details behind resampler, see libsoxr docs.\n\nPython-SoXR package comes with [modified version](https://github.com/dofuuz/soxr) of libsoxr.
