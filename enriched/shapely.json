It is using the widely deployed open-source\ngeometry library `GEOS `__ (the engine of `PostGIS\n`__, and a port of `JTS `__).\nShapely wraps GEOS geometries and operations to provide both a feature rich\n`Geometry` interface for singular (scalar) geometries and higher-performance\nNumPy ufuncs for operations using arrays of geometries.\nShapely is not primarily focused on data serialization formats or coordinate\nsystems, but can be readily integrated with packages that are.\n\nWhat is a ufunc?\n----------------\n\nA universal function (or ufunc for short) is a function that operates on\n*n*-dimensional arrays on an element-by-element fashion and supports array\nbroadcasting. The underlying ``for`` loops are implemented in C to reduce the\noverhead of the Python interpreter.\n\nMultithreading\n--------------\n\nShapely functions generally support multithreading by releasing the Global\nInterpreter Lock (GIL) during execution. Normally in Python, the GIL prevents\nmultiple threads from computing at the same time. Shapely functions\ninternally release this constraint so that the heavy lifting done by GEOS can\nbe done in parallel, from a single Python process.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nHere is the canonical example of building an approximately circular patch by\nbuffering a point, using the scalar Geometry interface:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\nUsing the vectorized ufunc interface (instead of using a manual for loop),\ncompare an array of points with a polygon:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nSee the documentation for more examples and guidance: https://shapely.readthedocs.io\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nShapely 2.1 requires\n\n* Python >=3.10\n* GEOS >=3.9\n* NumPy >=1.21\n\nInstalling Shapely\n==================\n\nWe recommend installing Shapely using one of the available built\ndistributions, for example using ``pip`` or ``conda``:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\nSee the `installation documentation `__\nfor more details and advanced installation instructions.\n\nIntegration\n===========\n\nShapely does not read or write data files, but it can serialize and deserialize\nusing several well known formats and protocols. The shapely.wkb and shapely.wkt\nmodules provide dumpers and loaders inspired by Python's pickle module.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\nShapely can also integrate with other Python GIS packages using GeoJSON-like\ndicts.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nQuestions about using Shapely may be asked on the `GIS StackExchange\n`__ using the \"shapely\"\ntag.\n\nBugs may be reported at https://github.com/shapely/shapely/issues.\n\nCopyright & License\n===================\n\nShapely is licensed under BSD 3-Clause license.\nGEOS is available under the terms of GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) 2.1 at https://libgeos.org.",
