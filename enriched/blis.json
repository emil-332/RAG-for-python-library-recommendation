If you want to\ninstall from source and you're on Windows, you'll need to install LLVM.\n\nBuilding BLIS for alternative architectures\n\nThe provided wheels should work on x86_64 architectures. Unfortunately we do not\ncurrently know a way to provide different wheels for alternative architectures,\nand we cannot provide a single binary that works everywhere. So if the wheel\ndoesn't work for your CPU, you'll need to specify source distribution, and tell\nBlis your CPU architecture using the `BLIS_ARCH` environment variable.\n\na) Installing with generic arch support\n\nb) Building specific support\n\nIn order to compile Blis, `cython-blis` bundles makefile scripts for specific\narchitectures, that are compiled by running the Blis build system and logging\nthe commands. We do not yet have logs for every architecture, as there are some\narchitectures we have not had access to.\n\n[See here](https://github.com/flame/blis/blob/0.5.1/config_registry) for list of\narchitectures. For example, here's how to build support for the ARM architecture\n`cortexa57`:\n\nFingers crossed, this will build you a wheel that supports your platform. You\ncould then [submit a PR](https://github.com/explosion/cython-blis/pulls) with\nthe `blis/_src/make/linux-cortexa57.jsonl` and\n`blis/_src/include/linux-cortexa57/blis.h` files so that you can run:\n\nUsage\n\nTwo APIs are provided: a high-level Python API, and direct\n[Cython](http://cython.org) access, which provides fused-type, nogil Cython\nbindings to the underlying Blis linear algebra library. Fused types are a simple\ntemplate mechanism, allowing just a touch of compile-time generic programming:\n\nBindings have been added as we've needed them. Please submit pull requests if\nthe library is missing some functions you require.\n\nDevelopment\n\nTo build the source package, you should run the following command:\n\nThis populates the `blis/_src` folder for the various architectures, using the\n`flame-blis` submodule.\n\nUpdating the build files\n\nIn order to compile the Blis sources, we use jsonl files that provide the\nexplicit compiler flags. We build these jsonl files by running Blis's build\nsystem, and then converting the log. This avoids us having to replicate the\nbuild system within Python: we just use the jsonl to make a bunch of subprocess\ncalls. To support a new OS/architecture combination, we have to provide the\njsonl file and the header.\n\nLinux\n\nThe Linux build files need to be produced from within the manylinux1 docker\ncontainer, so that they will be compatible with the wheel building process.\n\nFirst, install docker. Then do the following to start the container:\n\nOnce within the container, the following commands should check out the repo and\nbuild the jsonl files for the generic arch:\n\nThen from a new terminal, retrieve the two files we need out of the container:",
