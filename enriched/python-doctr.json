      "text": "Quick Tour\n\nGetting your pretrained model\n\nEnd-to-End OCR is achieved in docTR using a two-stage approach: text detection (localizing words), then text recognition (identify all characters in the word).\nAs such, you can select the architecture used for [text detection](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/latest/modules/models.html#doctr-models-detection), and the one for [text recognition](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/latest//modules/models.html#doctr-models-recognition) from the list of available implementations.\n\nReading files\n\nDocuments can be interpreted from PDF or images:\n\nPutting it together\n\nLet's use the default pretrained model for an example:\n\nDealing with rotated documents\n\nShould you use docTR on documents that include rotated pages, or pages with multiple box orientations,\nyou have multiple options to handle it:\n\n- If you only use straight document pages with straight words (horizontal, same reading direction),\nconsider passing `assume_straight_boxes=True` to the ocr_predictor. It will directly fit straight boxes\non your page and return straight boxes, which makes it the fastest option.\n\n- If you want the predictor to output straight boxes (no matter the orientation of your pages, the final localizations\nwill be converted to straight boxes), you need to pass `export_as_straight_boxes=True` in the predictor. Otherwise, if `assume_straight_pages=False`, it will return rotated bounding boxes (potentially with an angle of 0°).\n\nIf both options are set to False, the predictor will always fit and return rotated boxes.\n\nTo interpret your model's predictions, you can visualize them interactively as follows:\n\nOr even rebuild the original document from its predictions:\n\nThe `ocr_predictor` returns a `Document` object with a nested structure (with `Page`, `Block`, `Line`, `Word`, `Artefact`).\nTo get a better understanding of our document model, check our [documentation](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/modules/io.html#document-structure):\n\nYou can also export them as a nested dict, more appropriate for JSON format:\n\nUse the KIE predictor\n\nThe KIE predictor is a more flexible predictor compared to OCR as your detection model can detect multiple classes in a document. For example, you can have a detection model to detect just dates and addresses in a document.\n\nThe KIE predictor makes it possible to use detector with multiple classes with a recognition model and to have the whole pipeline already setup for you.\n\nThe KIE predictor results per page are in a dictionary format with each key representing a class name and it's value are the predictions for that class.\n\nIf you are looking for support from the Mindee team\n\n(https://mindee.com/product/doctr)\n\nInstallation\n\nPrerequisites\n\nPython 3.10 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are required to install docTR.\n\nLatest release\n\nYou can then install the latest release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/python-doctr/) as follows:\n\nWe try to keep extra dependencies to a minimum. You can install specific builds as follows:\n\nDeveloper mode\n\nAlternatively, you can install it from source, which will require you to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\nFirst clone the project repository:\n\nAgain, if you prefer to avoid the risk of missing dependencies, you can install the build:\n\nModels architectures\n\nCredits where it's due: this repository is implementing, among others, architectures from published research papers.\n\nText Detection\n\nText Recognition\n\nMore goodies\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe full package documentation is available [here](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/) for detailed specifications.\n\nDemo app",

      "text": "A minimal demo app is provided for you to play with our end-to-end OCR models!\n\nLive demo\n\nCourtesy of :hugs: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) :hugs:, docTR has now a fully deployed version available on [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)!\nCheck it out (https://huggingface.co/spaces/mindee/doctr)\n\nRunning it locally\n\nIf you prefer to use it locally, there is an extra dependency ([Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)) that is required.\n\nThen run your app in your default browser with:\n\nDocker container\n\nWe offer Docker container support for easy testing and deployment. [Here are the available docker tags.](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/pkgs/container/doctr).\n\nUsing GPU with docTR Docker Images\n\nThe docTR Docker images are GPU-ready and based on CUDA `12.2`. Make sure your host is **at least `12.2`**, otherwise Torch won't be able to initialize the GPU.\nPlease ensure that Docker is configured to use your GPU.\n\nTo verify and configure GPU support for Docker, please follow the instructions provided in the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).\n\nOnce Docker is configured to use GPUs, you can run docTR Docker containers with GPU support:\n\nAvailable Tags\n\nThe Docker images for docTR follow a specific tag nomenclature: `-py-`. Here's a breakdown of the tag structure:\n\n- ``: `torch`, `torch-viz-html-contrib`.\n- ``: `3.9.18`, `3.10.13` or `3.11.8`.\n- ``: a tag >= `v0.11.0`\n- ``: e.g. `2014-10`\n\nHere are examples of different image tags:\n\nTag\n----------------------------\n`torch-viz-html-contrib-py3.11.8-2024-10`\n`torch-py3.11.8-2024-10`\n\nBuilding Docker Images Locally\n\nYou can also build docTR Docker images locally on your computer.\n\nYou can specify custom Python versions and docTR versions using build arguments. For example, to build a docTR image with PyTorch, Python version `3.9.10`, and docTR version `v0.7.0`, run the following command:\n\nExample script\n\nAn example script is provided for a simple documentation analysis of a PDF or image file:\n\nAll script arguments can be checked using `python scripts/analyze.py --help`\n\nMinimal API integration\n\nLooking to integrate docTR into your API? Here is a template to get you started with a fully working API using the wonderful [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) framework.\n\nDeploy your API locally\n\nSpecific dependencies are required to run the API template, which you can install as follows:\n\nYou can now run your API locally:\n\nAlternatively, you can run the same server on a docker container if you prefer using:\n\nWhat you have deployed\n\nYour API should now be running locally on your port 8002. Access your automatically-built documentation at [http://localhost:8002/redoc](http://localhost:8002/redoc) and enjoy your three functional routes (\"/detection\", \"/recognition\", \"/ocr\", \"/kie\"). Here is an example with Python to send a request to the OCR route:\n\nExample notebooks\n\nLooking for more illustrations of docTR features? You might want to check the [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/tree/main/notebooks) designed to give you a broader overview.\n\nCitation\n\nIf you wish to cite this project, feel free to use this [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) reference:\n\nContributing\n\nIf you scrolled down to this section, you most likely appreciate open source. Do you feel like extending the range of our supported characters? Or perhaps submitting a paper implementation? Or contributing in any other way?\n\nYou're in luck, we compiled a short guide (cf. [`CONTRIBUTING`](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/contributing/contributing.html)) for you to easily do so!\n\nLicense",
