      "text": "What is Agno?\n\nAgno is a multi-agent framework, runtime, and control plane. Use it to build private and secure AI products that run in your cloud.\n\n- **Build** agents, teams, and workflows with memory, knowledge, guardrails, and 100+ toolkits.\n- **Run** in production with a stateless FastAPI runtime. Horizontally scalable.\n- **Manage** with a control plane that connects directly to your runtime — no data leaves your environment.\n\nWhy Agno?\n\n- **Your cloud, your data:** AgentOS runs entirely in your infrastructure. Zero data leaves your environment.\n- **Production-ready from day one:** Pre-built FastAPI runtime with SSE endpoints, ready to deploy.\n- **Actually fast:** 529× faster than LangGraph, 24× lower memory. Matters at scale.\n\nGetting Started\n\nNew to Agno? Start with the [getting started guide](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/00_getting_started).\n\nThen:\n- Browse the [cookbooks](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook) for real-world examples\n- Read the [docs](https://docs.agno.com) to learn more.\n\nResources\n\n- Docs: docs.agno.com\n- Cookbook: Cookbook\n- Community forum: community.agno.com\n- Discord: discord\n\nExample\n\nHere's an example of an Agent that connects to an MCP server, manages conversation state in a database, is served using a FastAPI application that you can chat with using the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).\n\nAgentOS - Production Runtime for Multi-Agent Systems\n\nBuilding Agents is easy, running them as a secure, scalable service is hard. AgentOS solves this by providing a high performance runtime for serving multi-agent systems in production. Key features include:\n\n1. **Pre-built FastAPI app**: AgentOS includes a ready-to-use FastAPI app for running your agents, teams and workflows. This gives you a significant head start when building an AI product.\n\n2. **Integrated Control Plane**: The [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) connects directly to your runtime, so you can test, monitor and manage your system in real time with full operational visibility.\n\n3. **Private by Design**: AgentOS runs entirely in your cloud, ensuring complete data privacy. No data leaves your environment, making it ideal for security conscious enterprises..\n\nWhen you run the example script shared above, you get a FastAPI app that you can connect to the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com). Here's what it looks like in action:\n\nPrivate by Design\n\nThis is the part we care most about.\n\nAgentOS runs in **your** cloud. The control plane UI connects directly to your runtime from your browser. Your data never touches our servers. No retention costs, no vendor lock-in, no compliance headaches.\n\nThis isn't a privacy mode or enterprise add-on. It's how Agno works.\n\nFeatures\n\n**Core**\n- Model agnostic — works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models, whatever\n- Type-safe I/O with `input_schema` and `output_schema`\n- Async-first, built for long-running tasks\n- Natively multimodal (text, images, audio, video, files)\n\n**Memory & Knowledge**\n- Persistent storage for session history and state\n- User memory that persists across sessions\n- Agentic RAG with 20+ vector stores, hybrid search, reranking\n- Culture — shared long-term memory across agents\n\n**Execution**\n- Human-in-the-loop (confirmations, approvals, overrides)\n- Guardrails for validation and security\n- Pre/post hooks for the agent lifecycle\n- First-class MCP and A2A support\n- 100+ built-in toolkits\n\n**Production**\n- Ready-to-use FastAPI runtime\n- Integrated control plane UI\n- Evals for accuracy, performance, latency\n- Durable execution for resumable workflows\n- RBAC and per-agent permissions\n\nPerformance\n\nWe're obsessive about performance because agent workloads spawn hundreds of instances and run long tasks. Stateless, horizontal scalability isn't optional.\n\n**Benchmarks** (Apple M4 MacBook Pro, Oct 2025):\n\nMetric\n--------\nInstantiation\nMemory\n\nRun the benchmarks yourself: [`cookbook/evals/performance`](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/evals/performance)\n\nIDE Integration\n\nFor AI-assisted development, add our docs to your IDE:\n\n**Cursor:** Settings → Indexing & Docs → Add `https://docs.agno.com/llms-full.txt`\n\nWorks with VSCode, Windsurf, and other AI-enabled editors too.\n\nContributing\n\nWe welcome contributions. See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/v2.0/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTelemetry\n\nAgno logs which model providers are used so we can prioritize updates. Disable with `AGNO_TELEMETRY=false`.\n\n  ⬆️ Back to Top",
