It combines the capabilities of `pandas`_ and `shapely`_,\nproviding geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface\nto multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do\noperations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database\nsuch as PostGIS.\n\n.. _pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org\n.. _shapely: https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/",
