Pooch can help you too!\n\n* Host your data on a repository and download using the DOI.\n* Automatically download data using code instead of telling colleagues to do it themselves.\n* Make sure everyone running the code has the same version of the data files.\n\nProjects using Pooch\n\n[SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy), \n[scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image),\n[xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray),\n[Ensaio](https://github.com/fatiando/ensaio),\n[GemPy](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy),\n[MetPy](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy),\n[napari](https://github.com/napari/napari),\n[Satpy](https://github.com/pytroll/satpy),\n[yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt),\n[PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista),\n[icepack](https://github.com/icepack/icepack),\n[histolab](https://github.com/histolab/histolab),\n[seaborn-image](https://github.com/SarthakJariwala/seaborn-image),\n[Open AR-Sandbox](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/open_AR_Sandbox),\n[climlab](https://github.com/climlab/climlab),\n[mne-python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python),\n[GemGIS](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gemgis),\n[SHTOOLS](https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS),\n[MOABB](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb),\n[GeoViews](https://github.com/holoviz/geoviews),\n[ScopeSim](https://github.com/AstarVienna/ScopeSim),\n[Brainrender](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender),\n[pyxem](https://github.com/pyxem/pyxem),\n[cellfinder](https://github.com/brainglobe/cellfinder),\n[PVGeo](https://github.com/OpenGeoVis/PVGeo),\n[geosnap](https://github.com/oturns/geosnap),\n[BioCypher](https://github.com/biocypher/biocypher),\n[cf-xarray](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/cf-xarray),\n[Scirpy](https://github.com/scverse/scirpy),\n[rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg),\n[DASCore](https://github.com/DASDAE/dascore),\n[scikit-mobility](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/scikit-mobility),\n[Py-ART](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart),\n[HyperSpy](https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy),\n[RosettaSciIO](https://github.com/hyperspy/rosettasciio),\n[eXSpy](https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy)\n\n> If you're using Pooch, **send us a pull request** adding your project to the list.\n\nExample\n\nFor a **scientist downloading a data file** for analysis:\n\nFor **package developers** including sample data in their projects:\n\nGetting involved\n\n️ **Contact us:**\nFind out more about how to reach us at\n[fatiando.org/contact](https://www.fatiando.org/contact/).\n\n‍ **Contributing to project development:**\nPlease read our\n[Contributing Guide](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nto see how you can help and give feedback.\n\n‍‍ **Code of conduct:**\nThis project is released with a\n[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fatiando/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nBy participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n> **Imposter syndrome disclaimer:**\n> We want your help. **No, really.** There may be a little voice inside your\n> head that is telling you that you're not ready, that you aren't skilled\n> enough to contribute.
