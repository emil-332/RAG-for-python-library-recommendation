Please follow CUDA&reg; installation procedure in the NVIDIA&reg; [web](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers).\n\nIf you want to install our GPU supported simulators, you have to install this other package:\n\nThe package above is for CUDA&reg 12, so if your system has CUDA&reg; 11 installed, install separate package:\n\nThis will overwrite your current `qiskit-aer` package installation giving you\nthe same functionality found in the canonical `qiskit-aer` package, plus the\nability to run the GPU supported simulators: statevector, density matrix, and unitary.\n\n**Note**: This package is only available on x86_64 Linux. For other platforms\nthat have CUDA support, you will have to build from source. You can refer to\nthe [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#building-with-gpu-support)\nfor instructions on doing this.\n\nSimulating your first Qiskit circuit with Aer\nNow that you have Aer installed, you can start simulating quantum circuits using primitives and noise models. Here is a basic example:\n\nContribution Guidelines\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to Aer, please take a look at our\n[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). This project adheres to Qiskit's [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.\n\nWe use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues) for tracking requests and bugs. Please use our [slack](https://qiskit.slack.com) for discussion and simple questions.
