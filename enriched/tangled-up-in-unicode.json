  "usage_description": "This library is used to access and utilize the Unicode Character Database (UCD) for all Unicode characters, offering a more up-to-date and feature-rich alternative to Python's standard `unicodedata` library. With it, developers can take advantage of the latest UCD version, human-readable property names, and extended properties not available in the standard library."
