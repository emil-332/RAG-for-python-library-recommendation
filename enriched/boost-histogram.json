      "text": "Installation\n\nYou can install this library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/boost-histogram/) with pip:\n\nAll the normal best-practices for Python apply; Pip should not be very old (Pip\n9 is very old), you should be in a virtual environment, etc. Python 3.9+ is\nrequired; for older versions of Python (3.5 and 2.7), `0.13` will be installed\ninstead, which is API equivalent to 1.0, but will not be gaining new features.\n1.3.x was the last series to support Python 3.6. 1.4.x was the last series to\nsupport Python 3.7. 1.5.x was the last series to support Python 3.8.\n\nBinaries available:\n\nThe easiest way to get boost-histogram is to use a binary wheel, which happens\nwhen you run the above command on a supported platform. Wheels are produced using\n[cibuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/); all common\nplatforms have wheels provided in boost-histogram:\n\nSystem\n-------------\nmanylinux2014\nmanylinux2014\nmusllinux_1_1\nmacOS\nmacOS\nWindows\nWindows\n\nPowerPC or IBM-Z wheels are not provided but are available on request.\n\nIf you are on a Linux system that is not part of the \"many\" in manylinux or musl in musllinux, such as ClearLinux, building from source is usually fine, since the compilers on those systems are often quite new. It will just take longer to install when it is using the sdist instead of a wheel. All dependencies are header-only and included.\n\nConda-Forge\n\nThe boost-histogram package is available on [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/boost-histogram-feedstock), as well. All supported variants are available.\n\nSource builds\n\nFor a source build, for example from an \"SDist\" package, the only requirements are a C++14 compatible compiler. The compiler requirements are dictated by Boost.Histogram's C++ requirements: gcc >= 5.5, clang >= 3.8, or msvc >= 14.1.\n\nBoost is not required or needed (this only depends on included header-only dependencies). You can install directly from GitHub if you would like.\n\nDeveloping\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to set up a development environment.\n\nContributors\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the contributors that made this project possible ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.\n\nTalks and other documentation/tutorial sources\n\nThe [official documentation is here](https://boost-histogram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and includes a [quickstart](https://boost-histogram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/quickstart.html).\n\n---\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis library was primarily developed by Henry Schreiner and Hans Dembinski.\n\nSupport for this work was provided by the National Science Foundation cooperative agreement OAC-1836650 (IRIS-HEP) and OAC-1450377 (DIANA/HEP).
