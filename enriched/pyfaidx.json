This python module implements pure Python classes for\nindexing, retrieval, and in-place modification of FASTA files using a samtools\ncompatible index. The pyfaidx module is API compatible with the `pygr`_ seqdb module.\nA command-line script \"`faidx`_\" is installed alongside the pyfaidx module, and\nfacilitates complex manipulation of FASTA files without any programming knowledge.\n\n.. _`pygr`: https://github.com/cjlee112/pygr\n\nIf you use pyfaidx in your publication, please cite:\n\n`Shirley MD`_, `Ma Z`_, `Pedersen B`_, `Wheelan S`_. `Efficient \"pythonic\" access to FASTA files using pyfaidx `_.

This can be changed to [0, 0] by passing ``one_based_attributes=False`` to ``Fasta`` or ``Faidx``. This argument only affects the ``Sequence .start/.end`` attributes, and has no effect on slicing coordinates.\n\nIndexes like a list:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nSlices just like a string:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n- Slicing start and end coordinates are 0-based, just like Python sequences.\n\nComplements and reverse complements just like DNA\n\n.. code:: python\n\n``Fasta`` objects can also be accessed using method calls:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nSpliced sequences can be retrieved from a list of [start, end] coordinates:\n**TODO** update this section\n\n.. code:: python\n\n.. _keyfn:\n\nCustom key functions provide cleaner access:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nYou can specify a character to split names on, which will generate additional entries:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nIf your `key_function` or `split_char` generates duplicate entries, you can choose what action to take:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nFilter functions (returning True) limit the index:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nOr just get a Python string:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nYou can make sure that you always receive an uppercase sequence, even if your fasta file has lower case\n\n.. code:: python\n\nYou can also perform line-based iteration, receiving the sequence lines as they appear in the FASTA file:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nSequence names are truncated on any whitespace. This is a limitation of the indexing strategy. However, full names can be recovered:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nRecords can be accessed efficiently as numpy arrays:\n\n.. code:: python\n\nSequence can be buffered in memory using a read-ahead buffer\nfor fast sequential access:\n\n.. code:: python",

I.e.,\nfiles compressed with ``bgzip`` are valid ``gzip`` and so can be read by\n``gunzip``.  See `this description\n`_ for more details on\n``bgzip``.\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nPlease see the `releases `_ for a\ncomprehensive list of version changes.\n\nKnown issues\n------------\n\nI try to fix as many bugs as possible, but most of this work is supported by a single developer. Please check the `known issues `_ for bugs relevant to your work. Pull requests are welcome.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nCreate a new Pull Request with one feature. If you add a new feature, please\ncreate also the relevant test.\n\nTo get test running on your machine:\n - Create a new virtualenv and install the `dev-requirements.txt`.\n \n - Download the test data running:\n\n- Run the tests with\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThis project is freely licensed by the author, `Matthew\nShirley `_, and was completed under the\nmentorship and financial support of Drs. `Sarah\nWheelan `_ and `Vasan\nYegnasubramanian `_ at the Sidney Kimmel\nComprehensive Cancer Center in the Department of Oncology.\n\n.. |Travis| image:: https://travis-ci.com/mdshw5/pyfaidx.svg?branch=master\n\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyfaidx.svg?branch=master\n\n.. |Landscape| image:: https://landscape.io/github/mdshw5/pyfaidx/master/landscape.svg\n   :target: https://landscape.io/github/mdshw5/pyfaidx/master\n   :alt: Code Health\n\n:target: https://codecov.io/gh/mdshw5/pyfaidx\n\n:target: http://depsy.org/package/python/pyfaidx\n\n.. |Appveyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/80ihlw30a003596w?svg=true\n   :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mdshw5/pyfaidx\n\n:target: https://github.com/mdshw5/pyfaidx/actions/workflows/pypi.yml\n   \n.. |Downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/pyfaidx.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfaidx/",
