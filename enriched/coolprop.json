      "text": "Welcome to CoolProp\n\nCoolProp is a thermophysical property database and wrappers for a selection of programming environments.\nIt offers similar functionality to REFPROP, but CoolProp is open-source and free.\nIt was originally developed by Ian Bell, at the time a post-doc at the University of Liege, in Liege, Belgium.\n\n* CoolProp has flexible licensing terms: Commercial - ok! Academic? - ok! (https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n* For Python, get the latest release via `pip install coolprop` (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/CoolProp/) (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/CoolProp/)\n\n* ... other binaries are available from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/coolprop/files) (http://sourceforge.net/projects/coolprop/files) \n\n* There is also a bleeding edge nightly build of the [development version](http://sourceforge.net/projects/coolprop/files/CoolProp/nightly).\n\n* The documentation is available for the [latest release](http://www.coolprop.org) and the [development version](https://coolprop.github.io/devdocs/)\n\n* For any kind of question regarding CoolProp and its usage, you can ask the [CoolProp Discussions](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/discussions)\n\n* ... you might also find answers in our [FAQ](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/blob/master/FAQ.md)\n\n* If you found a bug or have an issue that requires the developers to become active, please file an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/issues)\n\n* [Contributions](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this project are welcomed and encouraged! If you wish to [contribute](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) bug fixes, patches, or new features, wrappers, or material properties, please submit a Pull Request with your code.\n\n* If you are new to Git and Github, please see the [CoolProp Wiki](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/wiki) for guidance on becoming a contributor to the project.\n\n* Accelerate development of things you really need implemented by posting at [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/coolprop)\n\n* Have a look at the coverity stats (https://scan.coverity.com/projects/coolprop)",
