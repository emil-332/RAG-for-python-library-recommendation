      "text": "Welcome to CoolProp\n\nCoolProp is a thermophysical property database and wrappers for a selection of programming environments.\nIt offers similar functionality to REFPROP, but CoolProp is open-source and free.\nIt was originally developed by Ian Bell, at the time a post-doc at the University of Liege, in Liege, Belgium.\n\n* CoolProp has flexible licensing terms: Commercial - ok! Academic? - ok! (https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n* For Python, get the latest release via `pip install coolprop` (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/CoolProp/) (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/CoolProp/)\n\n* ... other binaries are available from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/coolprop/files) (http://sourceforge.net/projects/coolprop/files) \n\n* There is also a bleeding edge nightly build of the [development version](http://sourceforge.net/projects/coolprop/files/CoolProp/nightly).\n\n* The documentation is available for the [latest release](http://www.coolprop.org) and the [development version](https://coolprop.github.io/devdocs/)\n\n* For any kind of question regarding CoolProp and its usage, you can ask the [CoolProp Discussions](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/discussions)\n\n* ... you might also find answers in our [FAQ](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/blob/master/FAQ.md)\n\n* If you found a bug or have an issue that requires the developers to become active, please file an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/issues)\n\n* [Contributions](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this project are welcomed and encouraged! If you wish to [contribute](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) bug fixes, patches, or new features, wrappers, or material properties, please submit a Pull Request with your code.\n\n* If you are new to Git and Github, please see the [CoolProp Wiki](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/wiki) for guidance on becoming a contributor to the project.\n\n* Accelerate development of things you really need implemented by posting at [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/coolprop)\n\n* Have a look at the coverity stats (https://scan.coverity.com/projects/coolprop)",

  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to access and utilize a comprehensive open-source database of thermodynamic and transport properties, providing developers with the ability to simulate and analyze complex thermophysical behavior in various systems. With CoolProp, developers can calculate essential properties such as enthalpy, entropy, and viscosity for a wide range of fluids and substances, enabling more accurate modeling and prediction of their behavior under different conditions."
