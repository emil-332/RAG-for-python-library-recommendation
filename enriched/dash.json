Read [our tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com/getting-started) (proudly crafted ️ with Dash itself).\n\n- [Docs](https://dash.plotly.com/getting-started): Create your first Dash app in under 5 minutes\n\n- [dash.gallery](https://dash.gallery): Dash app gallery with Python & R code\n\nDash App Examples\n\nDash App\n---\nHere’s a simple example of a Dash App that ties a Dropdown to a Plotly Graph. As the user selects a value in the Dropdown, the application code dynamically exports data from Google Finance into a Pandas DataFrame. This app was written in just **43** lines of code ([view the source](https://gist.github.com/chriddyp/3d2454905d8f01886d651f207e2419f0)).\nDash app code is declarative and reactive, which makes it easy to build complex apps that contain many interactive elements. Here’s an example with 5 inputs, 3 outputs, and cross filtering. This app was composed in just 160 lines of code, all of which were Python.\nDash uses [Plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) for charting. About 50 chart types are supported, including maps.\nDash isn't just for dashboards. You have full control over the look and feel of your applications. Here's a Dash App that's styled to look like a PDF report.\n\nTo learn more about Dash, read the [extensive announcement letter](https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-dash-5ecf7191b503) or [jump in with the user guide](https://plotly.com/dash).\n\nDash OSS & Dash Enterprise\n\nWith Dash Open Source, Dash apps run on your local laptop or workstation, but cannot be easily accessed by others in your organization.\n\nScale up with Dash Enterprise when your Dash app is ready for department or company-wide consumption. Or, launch your initiative with Dash Enterprise from the start to unlock developer productivity gains and hands-on acceleration from Plotly's team.\n\nML Ops Features: A one-stop shop for ML Ops: Horizontally scalable hosting, deployment, and authentication for your Dash apps. No IT or DevOps required.\n\nLow-Code Features: Low-code Dash app capabilities that supercharge developer productivity.\n\nEnterprise AI Features: Everything that your data science team needs to rapidly deliver AI/ML research and business initiatives.\n\nSee [https://plotly.com/contact-us/](https://plotly.com/contact-us/) to get in touch.",
