      "text": "*doit* comes from the idea of bringing the power of build-tools to execute any\nkind of task\n\n*doit* can be uses as a simple **Task Runner** allowing you to easily define ad hoc\ntasks, helping you to organize all your project related tasks in an unified\neasy-to-use & discoverable way.\n\n*doit* scales-up with an efficient execution model like a **build-tool**.\n*doit* creates a DAG (direct acyclic graph) and is able to cache task results.\nIt ensures that only required tasks will be executed and in the correct order\n(aka incremental-builds).\n\nThe *up-to-date* check to cache task results is not restricted to looking for\nfile modification on dependencies.  Nor it requires \"target\" files.\nSo it is also suitable to handle **workflows** not handled by traditional build-tools.\n\nTasks' dependencies and creation can be done dynamically during it is execution\nmaking it suitable to drive complex workflows and **pipelines**.\n\n*doit* is build with a plugin architecture allowing extensible commands, custom\noutput, storage backend and \"task loader\". It also provides an API allowing\nusers to create new applications/tools leveraging *doit* functionality like a framework.\n\n*doit* is a mature project being actively developed for more than 10 years.\nIt includes several extras like: parallel execution, auto execution (watch for file\nchanges), shell tab-completion, DAG visualisation, IPython integration, and more.\n\nSample Code\n===========\n\nDefine functions returning python dict with task's meta-data.\n\nSnippet from `tutorial `_:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  def task_imports():\n\n  def task_dot():\n\n  def task_draw():\n\nRun from terminal::\n\n  $ doit list\n  dot       generate a graphviz's dot graph from module imports\n  draw      generate image from a dot file\n  imports   find imports from a python module\n  $ doit\n  .  imports:requests.models\n  .  imports:requests.__init__\n  .  imports:requests.help\n  (...)\n  .  dot\n  .  draw\n\nProject Details\n===============\n\nlicense\n=======\n\nThe MIT License\nCopyright (c) 2008-2022 Eduardo Naufel Schettino",

  "usage_description": "This library, doit, is used to automate tasks and workflows in a project by providing a unified and efficient way to execute tasks in the correct order. It enables developers to easily define tasks, manage dependencies, and cache results for incremental builds and up-to-date checks."
