      "text": "Pyomo Overview\n\nPyomo is a Python-based open-source software package that supports a\ndiverse set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing\noptimization models. Pyomo can be used to define symbolic problems,\ncreate concrete problem instances, and solve these instances with\nstandard solvers. Pyomo supports a wide range of problem types,\nincluding:\n\n -  Linear programming\n -  Quadratic programming\n -  Nonlinear programming\n -  Mixed-integer linear programming\n -  Mixed-integer quadratic programming\n -  Mixed-integer nonlinear programming\n -  Mixed-integer stochastic programming\n -  Generalized disjunctive programming\n -  Differential algebraic equations\n -  Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints\n -  Constraint programming\n\nPyomo supports analysis and scripting within a full-featured programming\nlanguage. Further, Pyomo has also proven an effective framework for\ndeveloping high-level optimization and analysis tools.  For example, the\n[`mpi-sppy`](https://github.com/Pyomo/mpi-sppy) package provides generic\nsolvers for stochastic programming. `mpi-sppy` leverages the fact that\nPyomo's modeling objects are embedded within a full-featured high-level\nprogramming language, which allows for transparent parallelization of\nsubproblems using Python parallel communication libraries.\n\n* [Pyomo Home](https://www.pyomo.org)\n* [About Pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/about)\n* [Download](https://www.pyomo.org/installation/)\n* [Documentation](https://www.pyomo.org/documentation/)\n* [Performance Plots](https://pyomo.github.io/performance/)\n\nPyomo was formerly released as the Coopr software library.\n\nPyomo is available under the BSD License - see the \n[`LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo/blob/main/LICENSE.md) file.\n\nPyomo is currently tested with the following Python implementations:\n\n* CPython: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14\n* PyPy: 3.11\n\n_Testing and support policy_:\n\nAt the time of the first Pyomo release after the end-of-life of a minor Python\nversion, we will remove testing for that Python version.\n\nInstallation\n\nPyPI (https://pypi.org/project/Pyomo/) (https://pypistats.org/packages/pyomo)\n\nAnaconda (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyomo) (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyomo)\n\nTutorials and Examples\n\n* [Pyomo — Optimization Modeling in Python](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-68928-5)\n* [Pyomo Workshop Slides](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo-tutorials/blob/main/Pyomo-Workshop-December-2023.pdf)\n* [Prof. Jeffrey Kantor's Pyomo Cookbook](https://jckantor.github.io/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/)\n* The [companion notebooks](https://mobook.github.io/MO-book/intro.html)\n  for *Hands-On Mathematical Optimization with Python*\n* [Pyomo Gallery](https://github.com/Pyomo/PyomoGallery)\n\nGetting Help\n\nTo get help from the Pyomo community ask a question on one of the following:\n* [Use the #pyomo tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=pyomo)\n* [Pyomo Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/pyomo-forum)\n\nDevelopers\n\nPyomo development moved to this repository in June 2016 from\nSandia National Laboratories.
