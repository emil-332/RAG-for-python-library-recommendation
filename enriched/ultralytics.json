For comprehensive guidance on training, validation, prediction, and deployment, refer to our full [Ultralytics Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/).\n\nInstall\n\nInstall the `ultralytics` package, including all [requirements](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/pyproject.toml), in a [**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment with [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n\n(https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/) (https://clickpy.clickhouse.com/dashboard/ultralytics) (https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/)\n\nFor alternative installation methods, including [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics), [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics), and building from source via Git, please consult the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/).\n\n(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics) (https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics) (https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics)\n\nUsage\n\nCLI\n\nYou can use Ultralytics YOLO directly from the Command Line Interface (CLI) with the `yolo` command:\n\nThe `yolo` command supports various tasks and modes, accepting additional arguments like `imgsz=640`. Explore the YOLO [CLI Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli/) for more examples.\n\nPython\n\nUltralytics YOLO can also be integrated directly into your Python projects. It accepts the same [configuration arguments](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cfg/) as the CLI:\n\nDiscover more examples in the YOLO [Python Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python/).\n\nModels\n\nUltralytics supports a wide range of YOLO models, from early versions like [YOLOv3](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov3/) to the latest [YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/). The tables below showcase YOLO11 models pretrained on the [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/) dataset for [Detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/), [Segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/), and [Pose Estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/). Additionally, [Classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/) models pretrained on the [ImageNet](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/classify/imagenet/) dataset are available. [Tracking](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track/) mode is compatible with all Detection, Segmentation, and Pose models.
