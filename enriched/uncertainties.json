For more information, see https://uncertainties.readthedocs.io/\n\nBasic examples\n--------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\nMain features\n-------------\n\n- **Transparent calculations with uncertainties**: Little or\n  no modification of existing code is needed to convert calculations of floats\n  to calculations of values with uncertainties.\n\n- **Correlations** between expressions are correctly taken into\n  account.  Thus, ``x-x`` is exactly zero.\n\n- **Most  mathematical operations** are supported, including most\n  functions from the standard math_ module (sin,...).  Comparison\n  operators (``>``, ``==``, etc.) are supported too.\n\n- Many **fast operations on arrays and matrices** of numbers with\n  uncertainties are supported.\n\n- **Extensive support for printing** numbers with uncertainties\n  (including LaTeX support and pretty-printing).\n\n- Most uncertainty calculations are performed **analytically**.\n\n- This module also gives access to the **derivatives** of any\n  mathematical expression (they are used by `error\n  propagation theory`_, and are thus automatically calculated by this\n  module).\n\nInstallation or upgrade\n-----------------------\n\nTo install `uncertainties`, use::\n\nTo upgrade from an older version, use::\n\nFurther details are in the `on-line documentation\n`_.\n\nGit branches\n------------\n\nThe GitHub ``master`` branch is the latest development version, and is intended\nto be a stable pre-release version. It will be experimental, but should pass\nall tests..  Tagged releases will be available on GitHub, and correspond to the\nreleases to PyPI.  The GitHub ``gh-pages`` branch will contain a stable test version\nof the documentation that can be viewed at\n``_.  Other Github branches should be\ntreated as unstable and in-progress development branches.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis package and its documentation are released under the `Revised BSD\nLicense `_.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n..\n   Note from Eric Lebigot: I would like the origin of the package to\n   remain documented for its whole life. Thanks!\n\nThis package was created back around 2009 by `Eric O. LEBIGOT `_.\n\nOwnership of the package was taken over by the `lmfit GitHub organization `_ in 2024.\n\n.. _IPython: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n.. _math: https://docs.python.org/library/math.html\n.. _error propagation theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty\n.. _main website: https://uncertainties.readthedocs.io/",
