Optionally, use the `wandb login` CLI to configure an API key on your machine. You can skip this step -- W&B will prompt you for an API key the first time you use it.\n\nCreate a machine learning training experiment\n\nIn your Python script or notebook, initialize a W&B run with `wandb.init()`.\nSpecify hyperparameters and log metrics and other information to W&B.\n\nVisit [wandb.ai/home](https://wandb.ai/home) to view recorded metrics such as accuracy and loss and how they changed during each training step. Each run object appears in the Runs column with generated names.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIntegrations\n\nW&B [integrates](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/integrations) with popular ML frameworks and libraries making it fast and easy to set up experiment tracking and data versioning inside existing projects.\n\nFor developers adding W&B to a new framework, follow the [W&B Developer Guide](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/integrations/add-wandb-to-any-library).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nW&B Hosting Options\n\nWeights & Biases is available in the cloud or installed on your private infrastructure. Set up a W&B Server in a production environment in one of three ways:\n\n1. [Multi-tenant Cloud](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/hosting-options/multi_tenant_cloud?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code&utm_campaign=wandb&utm_content=hosting): Fully managed platform deployed in W&B’s Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account in GCP’s North America regions.\n2. [Dedicated Cloud](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code&utm_campaign=wandb&utm_content=hosting): Single-tenant, fully managed platform deployed in W&B’s AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud accounts. Each Dedicated Cloud instance has its own isolated network, compute and storage from other W&B Dedicated Cloud instances.\n3. [Self-Managed](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code&utm_campaign=wandb&utm_content=hosting): Deploy W&B Server on your AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud account or within your on-premises infrastructure.\n\nSee the [Hosting documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code&utm_campaign=wandb&utm_content=hosting) in the W&B Developer Guide for more information.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPython Version Support\n\nWe are committed to supporting our minimum required Python version for _at least_ six months after its official end-of-life (EOL) date, as defined by the Python Software Foundation. You can find a list of Python EOL dates [here](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).\n\nWhen we discontinue support for a Python version, we will increment the library’s minor version number to reflect this change.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nContribution guidelines\n\nWeights & Biases ️ open source, and we welcome contributions from the community! See the [Contribution guide](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on the development workflow and the internals of the wandb library. For wandb bugs and feature requests, visit [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues) or contact support@wandb.com.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nW&B Community\n\nBe a part of the growing W&B Community and interact with the W&B team in our [Discord](https://wandb.me/discord). Stay connected with the latest ML updates and tutorials with [W&B Fully Connected](https://wandb.ai/fully-connected).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLicense\n\n[MIT License](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/main/LICENSE)",
