With PuLP, it is simple to create MILP optimisation problems and solve them with the latest open-source (or proprietary) solvers.  PuLP can generate MPS or LP files and call solvers such as GLPK_, COIN-OR CLP/`CBC`_, CPLEX_, GUROBI_, MOSEK_, XPRESS_, CHOCO_, MIPCL_, HiGHS_, SCIP_/FSCIP_.\n\nThe documentation for PuLP can be `found here `_.\n\nPuLP is part of the `COIN-OR project `_. \n\nInstallation\n================\n\nPuLP requires Python 3.9 or newer.\n\nThe easiest way to install PuLP is with ``pip``. If ``pip`` is available on your system, type::\n\nOtherwise follow the download instructions on the `PyPi page `_.\n\nInstalling solvers\n----------------------\n\nPuLP can use a variety of solvers. The default solver is the COIN-OR CBC solver, which is included with PuLP. If you want to use other solvers, PuLP offers a quick way to install most solvers via their pypi package (some require a commercial license for running or for running large models)::\n\nIf you want to install all open source solvers (scip, highs, cylp), you can use the shortcut::\n\nFor more information on how to install solvers, see the `guide on configuring solvers `_.\n\nQuickstart \n===============\n\nUse ``LpVariable`` to create new variables. To create a variable x with 0  ≤  x  ≤  3::\n\nTo create a binary variable, y, with values either 0 or 1::\n\nUse ``LpProblem`` to create new problems. Create a problem called \"myProblem\" like so::\n\nCombine variables in order to create expressions and constraints, and then add them to the problem.::\n\nTo solve the problem  with the default included solver::\n\nIf you want to try another solver to solve the problem::\n\nDisplay the status of the solution::\n\nYou can get the value of the variables using ``value``. ex::\n\nEssential Classes\n------------------\n\n* ``LpProblem`` -- Container class for a Linear or Integer programming problem\n* ``LpVariable`` -- Variables that are added into constraints in the LP problem\n* ``LpConstraint`` -- Constraints of the general form\n\n* ``LpConstraintVar`` -- A special type of constraint for constructing column of the model in column-wise modelling\n\nUseful Functions\n------------------\n\n* ``value()`` -- Finds the value of a variable or expression\n* ``lpSum()`` -- Given a list of the form [a1*x1, a2*x2, ..., an*xn] will construct a linear expression to be used as a constraint or variable\n* ``lpDot()`` -- Given two lists of the form [a1, a2, ..., an] and [x1, x2, ..., xn] will construct a linear expression to be used as a constraint or variable\n\nMore Examples\n================\n\nSeveral tutorial are given in `documentation `_ and pure code examples are available in `examples/ directory `_ .\n\nThe examples use the default solver (CBC). To use other solvers they must be available (installed and accessible). For more information on how to do that, see the `guide on configuring solvers `_.\n\nFor Developers \n================\n\nIf you want to install the latest version from GitHub you can run::\n\nOn Linux and MacOS systems, you must run the tests to make the default solver executable::\n\nBuilding the documentation\n--------------------------\n\nThe PuLP documentation is built with `Sphinx `_.  We recommended using a\n`virtual environment `_ to build the documentation locally.\n\nTo build, run the following in a terminal window, in the PuLP root directory\n\n::\n\nA folder named html will be created inside the ``build/`` directory.\nThe home page for the documentation is ``doc/build/html/index.html`` which can be opened in a browser.\n\nContributing to PuLP\n-----------------------\nInstructions for making your first contribution to PuLP are given `here `_.\n\n**Comments, bug reports, patches and suggestions are very welcome!**\n\n* Comments and suggestions: https://github.com/coin-or/pulp/discussions\n* Bug reports: https://github.com/coin-or/pulp/issues\n* Patches: https://github.com/coin-or/pulp/pulls\n\nCopyright and License \n=======================\nPuLP is distributed under an MIT license. \n\n.. _Python: http://www.python.org/\n\n.. _GLPK: http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html\n.. _CBC: https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc\n.. _CPLEX: http://www.cplex.com/\n.. _GUROBI: http://www.gurobi.com/\n.. _MOSEK: https://www.mosek.com/\n.. _XPRESS: https://www.fico.com/es/products/fico-xpress-solver\n.. _CHOCO: https://choco-solver.org/\n.. _MIPCL: http://mipcl-cpp.appspot.com/\n.. _SCIP: https://www.scipopt.org/\n.. _HiGHS: https://highs.dev\n.. _FSCIP: https://ug.zib.de",
