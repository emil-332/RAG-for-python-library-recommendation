For a similar problem 10 million times larger than the one above (single-threaded on a 2.2 GHz processor),\n\n   * the Awkward Array one-liner takes **1.5 seconds** to run and uses **2.1 GB** of memory,\n   * the equivalent using Python lists and dicts takes **140 seconds** to run and uses **22 GB** of memory.\n\nAwkward Array is even faster when used in [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)'s JIT-compiled functions.\n\nSee the [Getting started](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/getting-started/index.html) documentation on [awkward-array.org](https://awkward-array.org) for an introduction, including a [no-install demo](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/_static/try-it.html) you can try in your web browser.\n\nGetting help\n\n   * View the documentation on [awkward-array.org](https://awkward-array.org/).\n   * Report bugs, request features, and ask for additional documentation on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/issues).\n   * If you have a \"How do I...?\" question, start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/discussions) with category \"Q&A\".\n   * Alternatively, ask about it on [StackOverflow with the [awkward-array] tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/awkward-array). Be sure to include tags for any other libraries that you use, such as Pandas or PyTorch.\n   * To ask questions in real time, try the Gitter [Scikit-HEP/awkward-array](https://gitter.im/Scikit-HEP/awkward-array) chat room.\n\nInstallation\n\nAwkward Array can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/awkward) using pip:\n\nThe `awkward` package is pure Python, and it will download the `awkward-cpp` compiled components as a dependency. If there is no `awkward-cpp` binary package (wheel) for your platform and Python version, pip will attempt to compile it from source (which has additional dependencies, such as a C++ compiler).\n\nAwkward Array is also available on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html#how-can-i-install-packages-from-conda-forge):",
