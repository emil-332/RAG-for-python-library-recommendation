You can start off by cloning a pre-defined\nproject template, adjust it to fit your needs, load in your data, train a\npipeline, export it as a Python package, upload your outputs to a remote storage\nand share your results with your team. Weasel can be used via the\n[`weasel`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/blob/main/docs/cli.md) command and we provide templates in our\n[`projects`](https://github.com/explosion/projects) repo.\n\nExample: Get started with a project template\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to clone a project template and run it – for\nexample, this [end-to-end template](https://github.com/explosion/projects/tree/v3/pipelines/tagger_parser_ud)\nthat lets you train a spaCy **part-of-speech\ntagger** and **dependency parser** on a Universal Dependencies treebank.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> Our [`projects`](https://github.com/explosion/projects) repo includes various\n> project templates for different NLP tasks, models, workflows and integrations\n> that you can clone and run. The easiest way to get started is to pick a\n> template, clone it and start modifying it!\n\nDocumentation\n\nGet started with the documentation:\n\nMigrating from spaCy Projects\n\nWeasel is a standalone replacement for spaCy Projects.\nThere are a few backward incompatibilities that you should be aware of:\n\n- The `SPACY_CONFIG_OVERRIDES` environment variable is no longer checked.\n  You can set configuration overrides using `WEASEL_CONFIG_OVERRIDES`.\n- Support for the `spacy_version` configuration key has been dropped.\n- Support for the `check_requirements` configuration key has been dropped.\n- Support for `SPACY_PROJECT_USE_GIT_VERSION` environment variable has been dropped.\n- Error codes are now Weasel-specific, and do not follow spaCy error codes.\n\nWeasel checks for the first three incompatibilities and will issue a\nwarning if you're using it with spaCy-specific configuration options.",

  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with the Weasel library:\n\nThis library is used to manage and share end-to-end workflows for various use cases and domains, allowing developers to orchestrate training, packaging, and serving custom pipelines. With Weasel, developers can easily create, train, export, and deploy their own custom pipelines as Python packages, making it simple to collaborate with teams on complex data processing tasks."
