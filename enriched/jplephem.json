It currently supports binary SPK files (extension\n``.bsp``) like `those distributed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n`_ that are:\n\n* **Type 2** — positions stored as Chebyshev polynomials, with velocity\n  derived by computing their derivative.\n\n* **Type 3** — positions and velocities both stored explicitly as\n  Chebyshev polynomials.\n\n* **Type 9** — a series of discrete positions and velocities, with\n  separate timestamps that do not need to be equally spaced.  Currently\n  there is only support for linear interpolation: for Type 9 ephemerides\n  of polynomial degree 1, not of any higher degrees.\n\nNote that even if an ephemeris isn’t one of the above types, you can\nstill use ``jplephem`` to read its text comment and list the segments\ninside, using the subcommands ``comment`` and ``daf`` described below.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe only third-party package that ``jplephem`` depends on is `NumPy\n`_, which ``pip`` will automatically attempt to\ninstall alongside ``pyephem`` when you run::\n\nIf you see NumPy compilation errors, then try downloading and installing\nNumPy directly from `its web site `_ or simply\nuse a distribution of Python with science tools already installed, like\n`Anaconda `_.\n\nNote that ``jplephem`` offers only the logic necessary to produce plain\nthree-dimensional vectors.  Most programmers interested in astronomy\nwill want to look at `Skyfield `_\ninstead, which uses ``jplephem`` but converts the numbers into more\ntraditional measurements like right ascension and declination.\n\nMost users will use ``jplephem`` with the Satellite Planet Kernel (SPK)\nfiles that the NAIF facility at NASA JPL offers for use with their own\nSPICE toolkit.  They have collected their most useful kernels beneath\nthe directory:\n\nTo learn more about SPK files, the official `SPK Required Reading\n`_\ndocument is available from the NAIF facility’s web site under the NASA\nJPL domain.\n\nCommand Line Tool\n-----------------\n\nIf you have downloaded a ``.bsp`` file, you can run ``jplephem`` from\nthe command line to display the data inside of it::\n\nYou can also take a large ephemeris and produce a smaller excerpt by\nlimiting the range of dates that it covers::\n\nThe comment text of the output ephemeris is copied verbatim from the\ninput ephemeris, with the addition of a few lines of text at the top\nthat identify the output file as a mere excerpt, and record the dates\nthe user asked for.\n\nYou will get an error if your starting year is negative, because Unix\ncommands expect a list of options when they see a dash.  The fix is to\nprovide a special argument ``--`` which says “I’m done passing options,\neven if the next argument stars with a dash”::",

For example, the\nJupiter satellite ephemeris ``jup310.bsp`` is famously large, weighing\nin a nearly a gigabyte.  But if all you need are Jupiter's satellites\nfor a few months, you can download considerably less data::\n\nIn this case only about one-thousandth of the ephemeris's data needed to\nbe downloaded.\n\nGetting Started With DE421\n--------------------------\n\nThe DE421 ephemeris is a useful starting point.  It weighs in at 17 MB,\nbut provides predictions over the years 1900–2050:\n\nAfter the kernel has downloaded, you can use ``jplephem`` to load this\nSPK file and learn about the segments it offers:\n\n>>> from jplephem.spk import SPK\n>>> kernel = SPK.open('de421.bsp')\n>>> print(kernel)\nFile type DAF/SPK and format LTL-IEEE with 15 segments:\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Mercury Barycenter (1)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Venus Barycenter (2)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Earth Barycenter (3)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Mars Barycenter (4)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Jupiter Barycenter (5)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Saturn Barycenter (6)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Uranus Barycenter (7)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Neptune Barycenter (8)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Pluto Barycenter (9)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Solar System Barycenter (0) -> Sun (10)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Earth Barycenter (3) -> Moon (301)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Earth Barycenter (3) -> Earth (399)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Mercury Barycenter (1) -> Mercury (199)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Venus Barycenter (2) -> Venus (299)\n1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Mars Barycenter (4) -> Mars (499)\n\nSince the next few examples involve vector output, let’s tell NumPy to\nmake vector output attractive.\n\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> np.set_printoptions(precision=3)\n\nEach segment of the file lets you predict the position of one body with\nrespect to another for a given Julian date.

You can learn about the underlying DAF\n  “Double Precision Array File” format, in case you ever need to open\n  other such array files in Python, through the ``DAF`` class in the\n  module ``jplephem.daf``.\n\n* An SPK file is made of segments.  When you first create an ``SPK``\n  kernel object ``k``, it examines the file and creates a list of\n  ``Segment`` objects that it keeps in a list under an attribute named\n  ``k.segments`` which you are free to examine in your own code by\n  looping over it.\n\n* There is more information about each segment beyond the one-line\n  summary that you get when you print out the SPK file, which you can\n  see by asking the segment to print itself verbosely:\n\n>>> segment = kernel[3,399]\n  >>> print(segment.describe())\n  1899-07-29..2053-10-09  Type 2  Earth Barycenter (3) -> Earth (399)\n\n* Each ``Segment`` loaded from the kernel has a number of attributes\n  that are loaded from the SPK file:",

It returns two floats and a NumPy array:\n\n>>> initial_epoch, interval_length, coefficients = segment.load_array()\n  >>> print(coefficients.shape)\n  (3, 14080, 13)\n\n* The square-bracket lookup mechanism ``kernel[3,399]`` is a\n  non-standard convenience that returns only the last matching segment\n  in the file.  While the SPK standard does say that the last segment\n  takes precedence, it also says that earlier segments for a particular\n  center-target pair should be fallen back upon for dates that the last\n  segment does not cover.  So, if you ever tackle a complicated kernel,\n  you will need to implement fallback rules that send some dates to the\n  final segment for a given center and target, but that send other dates\n  to earlier segments that are qualified to cover them.\n\n* If you are accounting for light travel time and require repeated\n  computation of the position, but then need the velocity at the end,\n  and want to avoid repeating the expensive position calculation, then\n  try out the ``segment.generate()`` method - it will let you ask for\n  the position, and then only proceed to the velocity once you are sure\n  that the light-time error is now small enough.\n\nHigh-Precision Dates\n--------------------\n\nSince all modern Julian dates are numbers larger than 2.4 million, a\nstandard 64-bit Python or NumPy float necessarily leaves only a limited\nnumber of bits available for the fractional part.  *Technical Note\n2011-02* from the United States Naval Observatory's Astronomical\nApplications Department suggests that the `precision possible with a\n64-bit floating point Julian date is around 20.1 µs\n`_.\n\nIf you need to supply times and receive back planetary positions with\ngreater precision than 20.1 µs, then you have two options.\n\nFirst, you can supply times using the special ``float96`` NumPy type,\nwhich is also aliased to the name ``longfloat``.  If you provide either\na ``float96`` scalar or a ``float96`` array as your ``tdb`` parameter to\nany ``jplephem`` routine, you should get back a high-precision result.\n\nSecond, you can split your date or dates into two pieces, and supply\nthem as a pair of arguments two ``tdb`` and ``tdb2``.  One popular\napproach for how to split your date is to use the ``tdb`` float for the\ninteger Julian date, and ``tdb2`` for the fraction that specifies the\ntime of day.  Nearly all ``jplephem`` routines accept this optional\n``tdb2`` argument if you wish to provide it, thanks to the work of\nMarten van Kerkwijk!\n\nSupport for Binary PCKs\n-----------------------",

The command’s output should now include all matching\n  segments from even a very large ephemeris.\n\n* Fixed the ``excerpt`` command so the calendar dates specified on the\n  command line produce Julian dates ending with the fraction ``.5``,\n  which makes excerpt endpoints more exact.",
