  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to create and validate GeoJSON data by providing a set of Pydantic models that conform to the official GeoJSON specification (rfc7946). With geojson-pydantic, developers can ensure the correctness and consistency of their geographic data, making it easier to integrate into their applications."
