It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\nits way towards this goal.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n- [Main Features](#main-features)\n- [Where to get it](#where-to-get-it)\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n- [Installation from sources](#installation-from-sources)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Background](#background)\n- [Getting Help](#getting-help)\n- [Discussion and Development](#discussion-and-development)\n- [Contributing to pandas](#contributing-to-pandas)\n\nMain Features\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n\nWhere to get it\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n\nThe list of changes to pandas between each release can be found\n[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html). For full\ndetails, see the commit logs at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas.\n\nDependencies\n\nSee the [full installation instructions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#dependencies) for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional dependencies.\n\nInstallation from sources\nTo install pandas from source you need [Cython](https://cython.org/) in addition to the normal\ndependencies above. Cython can be installed from PyPI:\n\nIn the `pandas` directory (same one where you found this file after\ncloning the git repo), execute:\n\nor for installing in [development mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip_install/#install-editable):\n\nSee the full instructions for [installing from source](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing_environment.html).\n\nLicense\n[BSD 3](LICENSE)\n\nDocumentation\nThe official documentation is hosted on [PyData.org](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).\n\nBackground\nWork on ``pandas`` started at [AQR](https://www.aqr.com/) (a quantitative hedge fund) in 2008 and\nhas been under active development since then.\n\nGetting Help\n\nFor usage questions, the best place to go to is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas).\nFurther, general questions and discussions can also take place on the [pydata mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pydata).\n\nDiscussion and Development\nMost development discussions take place on GitHub in this repo, via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues).\n\nFurther, the [pandas-dev mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pandas-dev) can also be used for specialized discussions or design issues, and a [Slack channel](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/community.html?highlight=slack#community-slack) is available for quick development related questions.\n\nThere are also frequent [community meetings](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/community.html#community-meeting) for project maintainers open to the community as well as monthly [new contributor meetings](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/community.html#new-contributor-meeting) to help support new contributors.\n\nAdditional information on the communication channels can be found on the [contributor community](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/community.html) page.\n\nContributing to pandas\n\n(https://www.codetriage.com/pandas-dev/pandas)\n\nAll contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.\n\nA detailed overview on how to contribute can be found in the **[contributing guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html)**.\n\nIf you are simply looking to start working with the pandas codebase, navigate to the [GitHub \"issues\" tab](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues) and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under [Docs](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=Docs&sort=updated&state=open) and [good first issue](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=good+first+issue&sort=updated&state=open) where you could start out.\n\nYou can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to [subscribe to pandas on CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/pandas-dev/pandas).\n\nOr maybe through using pandas you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking ‘this can be improved’...you can do something about it!\n\nFeel free to ask questions on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pydata) or on [Slack](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/community.html?highlight=slack#community-slack).\n\nAs contributors and maintainers to this project, you are expected to abide by pandas' code of conduct.
