See [what's new](https://hist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).\n\nInstallation\n\nYou can install this library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hist/) with pip:\n\nIf you do not need the plotting features, you can skip the `[plot]` and/or\n`[fit]` extras. `[fit]` is not currently supported in WebAssembly.\n\nFeatures\n\nHist currently provides everything boost-histogram provides, and the following enhancements:\n\n- Hist augments axes with names:\n  - `name=` is a unique label describing each axis.\n  - `label=` is an optional string that is used in plotting (defaults to `name`\n  - Indexing, projection, and more support named axes.\n  - Experimental `NamedHist` is a `Hist` that disables most forms of positional access, forcing users to use only names.\n\n- The `Hist` class augments `bh.Histogram` with simpler construction:\n  - `flow=False` is a fast way to turn off flow for the axes on construction.\n  - Storages can be given by string.\n  - `storage=` can be omitted, strings and storages can be positional.\n  - `data=` can initialize a histogram with existing data.\n  - `Hist.from_columns` can be used to initialize with a DataFrame or dict.\n  - You can cast back and forth with boost-histogram (or any other extensions).\n\n- Hist support QuickConstruct, an import-free construction system that does not require extra imports:\n  - Use `Hist.new.().().()`.\n  - Axes names can be full (`Regular`) or short (`Reg`).\n  - Histogram arguments (like `data=`) can go in the storage.\n\n- Extended Histogram features:\n  - Direct support for `.name` and `.label`, like axes.\n  - `.density()` computes the density as an array.\n  - `.profile(remove_ax)` can convert a ND COUNT histogram into a (N-1)D MEAN histogram.\n  - `.sort(axis)` supports sorting a histogram by a categorical axis. Optionally takes a function to sort by.\n  - `.fill_flattened(...)` will flatten and fill, including support for AwkwardArray.\n  - `.integrate(...)`, which takes the opposite arguments as `.project`.\n\n- Hist implements UHI+; an extension to the UHI (Unified Histogram Indexing) system designed for import-free interactivity:\n  - Uses `j` suffix to switch to data coordinates in access or slices.\n  - Uses `j` suffix on slices to rebin.\n  - Strings can be used directly to index into string category axes.\n\n- Quick plotting routines encourage exploration:\n  - `.plot()` provides 1D and 2D plots (or use `plot1d()`, `plot2d()`)\n  - `.plot2d_full()` shows 1D projects around a 2D plot.\n  - `.plot_ratio(...)` make a ratio plot between the histogram and another histogram or callable.\n  - `.plot_pull(...)` performs a pull plot.\n  - `.plot_pie()` makes a pie plot.\n  - `.show()` provides a nice str printout using Histoprint.\n\n- Stacks: work with groups of histograms with identical axes\n  - Stacks can be created with `h.stack(axis)`, using index or name of an axis (`StrCategory` axes ideal).\n  - You can also create with `hist.stacks.Stack(h1, h2, ...)`, or use `from_iter` or `from_dict`.\n  - You can index a stack, and set an entry with a matching histogram.\n  - Stacks support `.plot()` and `.show()`, with names (plot labels default to original axes info).\n  - Stacks pass through `.project`, `*`, `+`, and `-`.\n\n- New modules\n  - `intervals` supports frequentist coverage intervals.\n\n- Notebook ready: Hist has gorgeous in-notebook representation.\n  - No dependencies required\n\nUsage\n\nDevelopment\n\nFrom a git checkout, either use [nox](https://nox.thea.codes), or run:\n\nSee [Contributing](https://hist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) guidelines for information on setting up a development environment.\n\nContributors\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the contributors that made this project possible ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.\n\nTalks\n\n---\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis library was primarily developed by Henry Schreiner and Nino Lau.\n\nSupport for this work was provided by the National Science Foundation cooperative agreement OAC-1836650 (IRIS-HEP) and OAC-1450377 (DIANA/HEP).
