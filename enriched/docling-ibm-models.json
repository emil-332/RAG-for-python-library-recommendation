This package contains inference code for Layout model.\n\nInstall\n\nThe package provides two variants which allow to seemlessly switch between `opencv-python` and `opencv-python-headless`.\n\nPipeline Overview\n\nDatasets\nBelow we list datasets used with their description, source, and ***\"TableFormer Format\"***. The TableFormer Format is our processed version of the version of the original format to work with the dataloader out of the box, and to augment the dataset when necassary to add missing groundtruth (bounding boxes for empty cells).\n\nName\n-------------\nPubTabNet\nFinTabNet\nTableBank\n\nModels\n\nTableModel04:\n\n**TableModel04rs (OTSL)** is our SOTA method that using transformers in order to predict table structure and bounding box.\n\nConfiguration file\n\nExample configuration can be found inside test `tests/test_tf_predictor.py`\nThese are the main sections of the configuration file:\n\n- `dataset`: The directory for prepared data and the parameters used during the data loading.\n- `model`: The type, name and hyperparameters of the model. Also the directory to save/load the\n  trained checkpoint files.\n- `train`: Parameters for the training of the model.\n- `predict`: Parameters for the evaluation of the model.\n- `dataset_wordmap`: Very important part that contains token maps.\n\nModel weights\n\nYou can download the model weights and config files from the links:\n\n- [TableFormer Checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/ds4sd/docling-models/tree/main/model_artifacts/tableformer)\n- [beehive_v0.0.5](https://huggingface.co/ds4sd/docling-models/tree/main/model_artifacts/layout/beehive_v0.0.5)\n\nInference Tests\n\nYou can run the inference tests for the models with:\n\nThis will also generate prediction and matching visualizations that can be found here:\n`tests\\test_data\\viz\\`\n\nVisualization outlines:\n- `Light Pink`: border of recognized table\n- `Grey`: OCR cells\n- `Green`: prediction bboxes\n- `Red`: OCR cells matched with prediction\n- `Blue`: Post processed, match\n- `Bold Blue`: column header\n- `Bold Magenta`: row header\n- `Bold Brown`: section row (if table have one)\n\nDemo\n\nA demo application allows to apply the `LayoutPredictor` on a directory `` that contains\n`png` images and visualize the predictions inside another directory ``.\n\nFirst download the model weights (see above), then run:\n\ne.g.",
