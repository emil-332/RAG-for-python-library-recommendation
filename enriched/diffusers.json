For more details about installing [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), please refer to their official documentation.\n\nPyTorch\n\nWith `pip` (official package):\n\nWith `conda` (maintained by the community):\n\nApple Silicon (M1/M2) support\n\nPlease refer to the [How to use Stable Diffusion in Apple Silicon](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) guide.\n\nQuickstart\n\nGenerating outputs is super easy with  Diffusers. To generate an image from text, use the `from_pretrained` method to load any pretrained diffusion model (browse the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers&sort=downloads) for 30,000+ checkpoints):\n\nYou can also dig into the models and schedulers toolbox to build your own diffusion system:\n\nCheck out the [Quickstart](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/quicktour) to launch your diffusion journey today!\n\nHow to navigate the documentation\n\n**Documentation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/tutorials/tutorial_overview)\n[Loading](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/using-diffusers/loading)\n[Pipelines for inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/using-diffusers/overview_techniques)\n[Optimization](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16)\n[Training](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/overview)\n\nContribution\n\nWe ️  contributions from the open-source community!\nIf you want to contribute to this library, please check out our [Contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\nYou can look out for [issues](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues) you'd like to tackle to contribute to the library.\n\nAlso, say  in our public Discord channel . We discuss the hottest trends about diffusion models, help each other with contributions, personal projects or just hang out ☕.\n\nPopular Tasks & Pipelines\n\nPopular libraries using  Diffusers\n\n- +14,000 other amazing GitHub repositories \n\nThank you for using us ️.\n\nCredits\n\nThis library concretizes previous work by many different authors and would not have been possible without their great research and implementations. We'd like to thank, in particular, the following implementations which have helped us in our development and without which the API could not have been as polished today:\n\nWe also want to thank @heejkoo for the very helpful overview of papers, code and resources on diffusion models, available [here](https://github.com/heejkoo/Awesome-Diffusion-Models) as well as @crowsonkb and @rromb for useful discussions and insights.\n\nCitation",
