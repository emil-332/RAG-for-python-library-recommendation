Check out [Unstructured Platform](https://unstructured.io/enterprise). In addition to better processing performance, take advantage of chunking, embedding, and image and table enrichment generation, all from a low code UI or an API. [Request a demo](https://unstructured.io/contact) from our sales team to learn more about how to get started.\n\n:eight_pointed_black_star: Quick Start\n\nThere are several ways to use the `unstructured` library:\n* [Run the library in a container](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured#run-the-library-in-a-container) or\n* Install the library\n* For installation with `conda` on Windows system, please refer to the [documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installing.html#installation-with-conda-on-windows)\n\nRun the library in a container\n\nThe following instructions are intended to help you get up and running using Docker to interact with `unstructured`.\nSee [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you don't already have docker installed on your machine.\n\nNOTE: we build multi-platform images to support both x86_64 and Apple silicon hardware. `docker pull` should download the corresponding image for your architecture, but you can specify with `--platform` (e.g. `--platform linux/amd64`) if needed.\n\nWe build Docker images for all pushes to `main`. We tag each image with the corresponding short commit hash (e.g. `fbc7a69`) and the application version (e.g. `0.5.5-dev1`). We also tag the most recent image with `latest`. To leverage this, `docker pull` from our image repository.\n\nOnce pulled, you can create a container from this image and shell to it.\n\nYou can also build your own Docker image. Note that the base image is `wolfi-base`, which is\nupdated regularly. If you are building the image locally, it is possible `docker-build` could\nfail due to upstream changes in `wolfi-base`.\n\nIf you only plan on parsing one type of data you can speed up building the image by commenting out some\nof the packages/requirements necessary for other data types. See Dockerfile to know which lines are necessary\nfor your use case.\n\nOnce in the running container, you can try things directly in Python interpreter's interactive mode.\n\nInstalling the library\nUse the following instructions to get up and running with `unstructured` and test your\ninstallation.\n\n- Install the Python SDK to support all document types with `pip install \"unstructured[all-docs]\"`\n  - For plain text files, HTML, XML, JSON and Emails that do not require any extra dependencies, you can run `pip install unstructured`\n  - To process other doc types, you can install the extras required for those documents, such as `pip install \"unstructured[docx,pptx]\"`\n- Install the following system dependencies if they are not already available on your system.\n  Depending on what document types you're parsing, you may not need all of these.\n\n- For suggestions on how to install on the Windows and to learn about dependencies for other features, see the\n  installation documentation [here](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installing.html).\n\nAt this point, you should be able to run the following code:\n\nInstallation Instructions for Local Development\n\nThe following instructions are intended to help you get up and running with `unstructured`\nlocally if you are planning to contribute to the project.",

See [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#mac--homebrew) for more detailed instructions.\n\t\t* `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`\n\t  * `pyenv install 3.10`\n  * Linux instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#linux).\n\n* Create a virtualenv to work in and activate it, e.g. for one named `unstructured`:\n\n`pyenv  virtualenv 3.10 unstructured` \n\t`pyenv activate unstructured`\n\n* Run `make install`\n\n* Optional:\n  * To install models and dependencies for processing images and PDFs locally, run `make install-local-inference`.\n  * For processing image files, `tesseract` is required. See [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for installation instructions.\n  * For processing PDF files, `tesseract` and `poppler` are required. The [pdf2image docs](https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) have instructions on installing `poppler` across various platforms.\n\nAdditionally, if you're planning to contribute to `unstructured`, we provide you an optional `pre-commit` configuration\nfile to ensure your code matches the formatting and linting standards used in `unstructured`.\nIf you'd prefer not to have code changes auto-tidied before every commit, you can use  `make check` to see\nwhether any linting or formatting changes should be applied, and `make tidy` to apply them.\n\nIf using the optional `pre-commit`, you'll just need to install the hooks with `pre-commit install` since the\n`pre-commit` package is installed as part of `make install` mentioned above. Finally, if you decided to use `pre-commit`\nyou can also uninstall the hooks with `pre-commit uninstall`.\n\nIn addition to develop in your local OS we also provide a helper to use docker providing a development environment:\n\nThis starts a docker container with your local repo mounted to `/mnt/local_unstructured`. This docker image allows you to develop without worrying about your OS's compatibility with the repo and its dependencies.\n\n:clap: Quick Tour\n\nDocumentation\nFor more comprehensive documentation, visit https://docs.unstructured.io . You can also learn\nmore about our other products on the documentation page, including our SaaS API.\n\nHere are a few pages from the [Open Source documentation page](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/introduction/overview)\nthat are helpful for new users to review:\n\nPDF Document Parsing Example\nThe following examples show how to get started with the `unstructured` library. The easiest way to parse a document in unstructured is to use the `partition` function. If you use `partition` function, `unstructured` will detect the file type and route it to the appropriate file-specific partitioning function. If you are using the `partition` function, you may need to install additional dependencies per doc type.\nFor example, to install docx dependencies you need to run `pip install \"unstructured[docx]\"`.\nSee our  [installation guide](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/installation/full-installation) for more details.\n\nRun `print(\"\\n\\n\".join([str(el) for el in elements]))` to get a string representation of the\noutput, which looks like:\n\nSee the [partitioning](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/core-functionality/partitioning)\nsection in our documentation for a full list of options and instructions on how to use\nfile-specific partitioning functions.\n\n:guardsman: Security Policy\n\nSee our [security policy](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/security/policy) for\ninformation on how to report security vulnerabilities.\n\n:bug: Reporting Bugs",
