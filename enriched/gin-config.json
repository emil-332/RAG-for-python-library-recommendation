Functions or classes can be decorated with\n`@gin.configurable`, allowing default parameter values to be supplied from a\nconfig file (or passed via the command line) using a simple but powerful syntax.\nThis removes the need to define and maintain configuration objects (e.g.\nprotos), or write boilerplate parameter plumbing and factory code, while often\ndramatically expanding a project's flexibility and configurability.\n\nGin is particularly well suited for machine learning experiments (e.g. using\nTensorFlow), which tend to have many parameters, often nested in complex ways.\n\n**Authors**: Dan Holtmann-Rice, Sergio Guadarrama, Nathan Silberman\n**Contributors**: Oscar Ramirez, Marek Fiser",
