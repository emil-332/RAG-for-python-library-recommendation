Requires an API key and the first 1,000 parses are free.\n\n[Parserator Google Sheets App](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/parserator_parse_and_split_addresses/945974620840)\nParserator: Parse and Split Addresses allows you to easily split addresses into separate columns by street, city, state, zipcode and more right in Google Sheets.\n\nHow to use the usaddress python library\n\n1. Install usaddress with [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html), a tool for installing and managing python packages ([beginner's guide here](http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/)).\n\n  In the terminal,\n  \n  \n2. Parse some addresses!\n\n  \n\n  Note that `parse` and `tag` are different methods:\n\nHow to use this development code (for the nerds)\nusaddress uses [parserator](https://github.com/datamade/parserator), a library for making and improving probabilistic parsers - specifically, parsers that use [python-crfsuite](https://github.com/tpeng/python-crfsuite)'s implementation of conditional random fields. Parserator allows you to train the usaddress parser's model (a .crfsuite settings file) on labeled training data, and provides tools for adding new labeled training data.\n\nBuilding & testing the code in this repo\n\nTo build a development version of usaddress on your machine, run the following code in your command line:\n  \n\nThen run the testing suite to confirm that everything is working properly:\n\n   \n   \nHaving trouble building the code? [Open an issue](https://github.com/datamade/usaddress/issues/new) and we'd be glad to help you troubleshoot.\n\nAdding new training data\n\nIf usaddress is consistently failing on particular address patterns, you can adjust the parser's behavior by adding new training data to the model. [Follow our guide in the training directory](./training/README.md), and be sure to make a pull request so that we can incorporate your contribution into our next release!\n\nImportant links\n\n* Web Interface: https://parserator.datamade.us/usaddress\n* Python Package Distribution: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/usaddress\n* Python Package Documentation: https://usaddress.readthedocs.io/\n* API Documentation: https://parserator.datamade.us/api-docs\n* Repository: https://github.com/datamade/usaddress\n* Issues: https://github.com/datamade/usaddress/issues\n* Blog post: http://datamade.us/blog/parsing-addresses-with-usaddress\n\nTeam\n\n* [Forest Gregg](https://github.com/fgregg), DataMade\n* [Cathy Deng](https://github.com/cathydeng), DataMade\n* [Miroslav Batchkarov](http://mbatchkarov.github.io), University of Sussex\n* [Jean Cochrane](https://github.com/jeancochrane), DataMade\n\nBad Parses / Bugs\n\nReport issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/datamade/usaddress/issues)\n\nIf an address was parsed incorrectly, please let us know! You can either [open an issue](https://github.com/datamade/usaddress/issues/new) or (if you're adventurous) [add new training data to improve the parser's model.](./training/README.md) When possible, please send over a few real-world examples of similar address patterns, along with some info about the source of the data - this will help us train the parser and improve its performance.\n\nIf something in the library is not behaving intuitively, it is a bug, and should be reported.\n\nNote on Patches/Pull Requests\n \n* Fork the project.\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\n* Send us a pull request.
