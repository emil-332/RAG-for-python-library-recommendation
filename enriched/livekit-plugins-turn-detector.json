      "text": "Turn detector plugin for LiveKit Agents\n\nThis plugin introduces end-of-turn detection for LiveKit Agents using a custom open-weight model to determine when a user has finished speaking.\n\nTraditional voice agents use VAD (voice activity detection) for end-of-turn detection. However, VAD models lack language understanding, often causing false positives where the agent interrupts the user before they finish speaking.\n\nBy leveraging a language model specifically trained for this task, this plugin offers a more accurate and robust method for detecting end-of-turns.\n\nSee [https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/) for more information.\n\nInstallation\n\nUsage\n\nMultilingual model\n\nWe've trained a multilingual model that supports the following languages: `English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Russian, Turkish`\n\nThe multilingual model requires ~400MB of RAM and completes inferences in ~25ms.\n\nUsage with RealtimeModel\n\nThe turn detector can be used even with speech-to-speech models such as OpenAI's Realtime API. You'll need to provide a separate STT to ensure our model has access to the text content.\n\nRunning your agent\n\nThis plugin requires model files. Before starting your agent for the first time, or when building Docker images for deployment, run the following command to download the model files:\n\nDownloaded model files\n\nModel files are downloaded to and loaded from the location specified by the `HF_HUB_CACHE` environment variable. If not set, this defaults to `$HF_HOME/hub` (typically `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`).\n\nFor offline deployment, download the model files first while connected to the internet, then copy the cache directory to your deployment environment.\n\nModel system requirements\n\nThe end-of-turn model is optimized to run on CPUs with modest system requirements. It is designed to run on the same server hosting your agents.\n\nThe model requires <500MB of RAM and runs within a shared inference server, supporting multiple concurrent sessions.\n\nLicense\n\nThe plugin source code is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license.\n\nThe end-of-turn model is licensed under the [LiveKit Model License](https://huggingface.co/livekit/turn-detector/blob/main/LICENSE).",
