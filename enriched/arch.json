Version 4.8 is the final version that supported Python 2.7.\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocumentation from the main branch is hosted on\n[my github pages](https://bashtage.github.io/arch/).\n\nReleased documentation is hosted on\n[read the docs](https://arch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\n\nMore about ARCH\n\nMore information about ARCH and related models is available in the notes and\nresearch available at [Kevin Sheppard's site](https://www.kevinsheppard.com).\n\nContributing\n\nContributions are welcome. There are opportunities at many levels to contribute:\n\n- Implement new volatility process, e.g., FIGARCH\n- Improve docstrings where unclear or with typos\n- Provide examples, preferably in the form of IPython notebooks\n\nExamples\n\nVolatility Modeling\n\n- Mean models\n  - Constant mean\n  - Heterogeneous Autoregression (HAR)\n  - Autoregression (AR)\n  - Zero mean\n  - Models with and without exogenous regressors\n- Volatility models\n  - ARCH\n  - GARCH\n  - TARCH\n  - EGARCH\n  - EWMA/RiskMetrics\n- Distributions\n  - Normal\n  - Student's T\n  - Generalized Error Distribution\n\nSee the [univariate volatility example notebook](https://bashtage.github.io/arch/univariate/univariate_volatility_modeling.html) for a more complete overview.\n\nUnit Root Tests\n\n- Augmented Dickey-Fuller\n- Dickey-Fuller GLS\n- Phillips-Perron\n- KPSS\n- Zivot-Andrews\n- Variance Ratio tests\n\nSee the [unit root testing example notebook](https://bashtage.github.io/arch/unitroot/unitroot_examples.html)\nfor examples of testing series for unit roots.\n\nCointegration Testing and Analysis\n\n- Tests\n  - Engle-Granger Test\n  - Phillips-Ouliaris Test\n- Cointegration Vector Estimation\n  - Canonical Cointegrating Regression\n  - Dynamic OLS\n  - Fully Modified OLS\n\nSee the [cointegration testing example notebook](https://bashtage.github.io/arch/unitroot/unitroot_cointegration_examples.html)\nfor examples of testing series for cointegration.\n\nBootstrap\n\n- Bootstraps\n  - IID Bootstrap\n  - Stationary Bootstrap\n  - Circular Block Bootstrap\n  - Moving Block Bootstrap\n- Methods\n  - Confidence interval construction\n  - Covariance estimation\n  - Apply method to estimate model across bootstraps\n  - Generic Bootstrap iterator\n\nSee the [bootstrap example notebook](https://bashtage.github.io/arch/bootstrap/bootstrap_examples.html)\nfor examples of bootstrapping the Sharpe ratio and a Probit model from statsmodels.\n\nMultiple Comparison Procedures\n\n- Test of Superior Predictive Ability (SPA), also known as the Reality\n- Stepwise (StepM)\n- Model Confidence Set (MCS)\n\nSee the [multiple comparison example notebook](https://bashtage.github.io/arch/multiple-comparison/multiple-comparison_examples.html)\nfor examples of the multiple comparison procedures.\n\nLong-run Covariance Estimation\n\nKernel-based estimators of long-run covariance including the\nBartlett kernel which is known as Newey-West in econometrics.\nAutomatic bandwidth selection is available for all of the\ncovariance estimators.\n\nRequirements\n\nThese requirements reflect the testing environment. It is possible\nthat arch will work with older versions.\n\n- Python (3.9+)\n- NumPy (1.19+)\n- SciPy (1.5+)\n- Pandas (1.1+)\n- statsmodels (0.12+)\n- matplotlib (3+), optional\n\nOptional Requirements\n\n- Numba (0.49+) will be used if available **and** when installed without building the binary modules. In order to ensure that these are not built, you must set the environment variable `ARCH_NO_BINARY=1` and install without the wheel.\n\nor if using Powershell on windows\n\n- jupyter and notebook are required to run the notebooks\n\nInstalling\n\nStandard installation with a compiler requires Cython. If you do not\nhave a compiler installed, the `arch` should still install. You will\nsee a warning but this can be ignored. If you don't have a compiler,\n`numba` is strongly recommended.\n\npip\n\nReleases are available PyPI and can be installed with `pip`.\n\nYou can alternatively install the latest version from GitHub\n\nSetting the environment variable `ARCH_NO_BINARY=1` can be used to\ndisable compilation of the extensions.\n\nAnaconda\n\n`conda` users can install from conda-forge,\n\n**Note**: The conda-forge name is `arch-py`.\n\nWindows\n\nBuilding extension using the community edition of Visual Studio is\nsimple when using Python 3.8 or later. Building is not necessary when numba\nis installed since just-in-time compiled code (numba) runs as fast as\nahead-of-time compiled extensions.\n\nDeveloping\n\nThe development requirements are:\n\n- Cython (0.29+, if not using ARCH_NO_BINARY=1, supports 3.0.0b2+)\n- pytest (For tests)\n- sphinx (to build docs)\n- sphinx-immaterial (to build docs)\n- jupyter, notebook and nbsphinx (to build docs)\n\nInstallation Notes\n\n1. If Cython is not installed, the package will be installed\n2. Setup does not verify these requirements. Please ensure these are",
