It is designed to help you efficiently create, customize, and\ndeploy new generative AI models by leveraging existing code and\npre-trained model checkpoints.\n\nFor technical documentation, please see the [NeMo Framework User\nGuide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html).\n\nWhat's New in NeMo 2.0\n\nNVIDIA NeMo 2.0 introduces several significant improvements over its predecessor, NeMo 1.0, enhancing flexibility, performance, and scalability.\n\n- **Python-Based Configuration** - NeMo 2.0 transitions from YAML files to a Python-based configuration, providing more flexibility and control. This shift makes it easier to extend and customize configurations programmatically.\n\n- **Modular Abstractions** - By adopting PyTorch Lightning’s modular abstractions, NeMo 2.0 simplifies adaptation and experimentation. This modular approach allows developers to more easily modify and experiment with different components of their models.\n\n- **Scalability** - NeMo 2.0 seamlessly scaling large-scale experiments across thousands of GPUs using [NeMo-Run](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Run), a powerful tool designed to streamline the configuration, execution, and management of machine learning experiments across computing environments.\n\nOverall, these enhancements make NeMo 2.0 a powerful, scalable, and user-friendly framework for AI model development.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> NeMo 2.0 is currently supported by the LLM (large language model) and VLM (vision language model) collections.\n\nGet Started with NeMo 2.0\n\nGet Started with Cosmos\n\nNeMo Curator and NeMo Framework support video curation and post-training of the Cosmos World Foundation Models, which are open and available on [NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/cosmos/collections/cosmos) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/cosmos-6751e884dc10e013a0a0d8e6). For more information on video datasets, refer to [NeMo Curator](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-curator). To post-train World Foundation Models using the NeMo Framework for your custom physical AI tasks, see the [Cosmos Diffusion models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos/blob/main/cosmos1/models/diffusion/nemo/post_training/README.md) and the [Cosmos Autoregressive models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos/blob/main/cosmos1/models/autoregressive/nemo/post_training/README.md).\n\nLLMs and MMs Training, Alignment, and Customization\n\nAll NeMo models are trained with\n[Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning). Training is\nautomatically scalable to 1000s of GPUs. You can check the performance benchmarks using the\nlatest NeMo Framework container [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/performance/performance_summary.html).\n\nWhen applicable, NeMo models leverage cutting-edge distributed training\ntechniques, incorporating [parallelism\nstrategies](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/modeloverview.html)\nto enable efficient training of very large models. These techniques\ninclude Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Fully\nSharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Mixed\nPrecision Training with BFloat16 and FP8, as well as others.",

[NeMo-Run](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Run) is recommended for launching experiments using NeMo 2.0.\n\n[NeMo Framework\nLauncher](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher) is a\ncloud-native tool that streamlines the NeMo Framework experience. It is\nused for launching end-to-end NeMo Framework training jobs on CSPs and\nSlurm clusters.\n\nThe NeMo Framework Launcher includes extensive recipes, scripts,\nutilities, and documentation for training NeMo LLMs. It also includes\nthe NeMo Framework [Autoconfigurator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher#53-using-autoconfigurator-to-find-the-optimal-configuration),\nwhich is designed to find the optimal model parallel configuration for\ntraining on a specific cluster.\n\nTo get started quickly with the NeMo Framework Launcher, please see the\n[NeMo Framework\nPlaybooks](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html).\nThe NeMo Framework Launcher does not currently support ASR and TTS\ntraining, but it will soon.\n\nGet Started with NeMo Framework\n\nGetting started with NeMo Framework is easy.
