Rasterio reads and writes these formats and\nprovides a Python API based on N-D arrays.\n\nRasterio 1.4.4+ works with Python >= 3.10, Numpy >= 1.24, and GDAL >= 3.6. Official\nbinary packages for Linux, macOS, and Windows with most built-in format drivers\nplus HDF5, netCDF, and OpenJPEG2000 are available on PyPI.\n\nRead the documentation for more details: https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/.\n\nExample\n=======\n\nHere's an example of some basic features that Rasterio provides. Three bands\nare read from an image and averaged to produce something like a panchromatic\nband.  This new band is then written to a new single band TIFF.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\nThe output:\n\n.. image:: http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5501/11393054644_74f54484d9_z_d.jpg\n   :width: 640\n   :height: 581\n\nAPI Overview\n============\n\nRasterio gives access to properties of a geospatial raster file.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\nA rasterio dataset also provides methods for getting read/write windows (like\nextended array slices) given georeferenced coordinates.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\nRasterio CLI\n============\n\nRasterio's command line interface, named \"rio\", is documented at `cli.rst\n`__. Its ``rio\ninsp`` command opens the hood of any raster dataset so you can poke around\nusing Python.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\nRio Plugins\n-----------\n\nRio provides the ability to create subcommands using plugins.  See\n`cli.rst `__\nfor more information on building plugins.\n\nSee the\n`plugin registry `__\nfor a list of available plugins.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nSee `docs/installation.rst `__\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nThe primary forum for questions about installation and usage of Rasterio is\nquestions when they have expertise to share and time to explain. Please take\nthe time to craft a clear question and be patient about responses.\n\nPlease do not bring these questions to Rasterio's issue tracker, which we want\nto reserve for bug reports and other actionable issues.\n\nDevelopment and Testing\n=======================\n\nSee `CONTRIBUTING.rst `__.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nSee `docs/ `__.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nSee `LICENSE.txt `__.\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nThe `rasterio` project was begun at Mapbox and was transferred to the `rasterio` Github organization in October 2021.\n\nSee `AUTHORS.txt `__.\n\nChanges\n=======\n\nSee `CHANGES.txt `__.\n\nWho is Using Rasterio?\n======================\n\nSee `here `__.",
