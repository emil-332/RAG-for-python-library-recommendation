(1998)' by Jean Meeus.\n\nThere are great astronomical libraries out there. For instance, if\nyou're looking for high precision and speed you should take a look at\n`libnova `__. For a set of python\nmodules aimed at professional astronomers, you should look at\n`Astropy `__. On the other hand, the advantages\nof PyMeeus are its simplicity, ease of use, ease of reading, ease of\ninstallation (it has the minimum amount of dependencies) and abundant\ndocumentation.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe easiest way of installing PyMeeus is using pip:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\nOr, for a per-user installation:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\nIf you prefer Python3, you can use:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\npip3 install --user pymeeus\n\nIf you have PyMeeus already installed, but want to upgrade to the latest\nversion:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\npip3 install -U pymeeus\n\nProperly Using PyMeeus\n----------------------\n\nIt is very common to try to run PyMeeus like this:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\nimport pymeeus\n\nmydate = pymeeus.Epoch(1992, 10, 13.0)\n\nBut if you do that, you'll get an error like this:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n   AttributeError: module 'pymeeus' has no attribute 'Epoch'\n\nThis issue points to a misunderstanding that is very common in the\nPython world. The keyword ``import`` is used to import **MODULES**\\ ...\nbut PyMeeus is **NOT** a module: It is a **LIBRARY** composed of\n**MULTIPLE** modules (``Angle``, ``Epoch``, ``Coordinates``, etc). As of\ntoday, the library Pymeeus has 19 different modules (if you look into\nthe directory where ``pip`` stores the library, you'll find one \".py\"\nfile per module).\n\nTherefore if you want to use, for example, the module ``Angle`` you\nshould use:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\nimport pymeeus.Angle\n\nI.e., your *module* is ``pymeeus.Angle``, and not just ``Angle``.\n\nBut there is more! When you use ``import`` to fetch a module, you must\nthen use the *dot* notation to access the components of the module\n(classes, functions, etc). For instance:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\nimport pymeeus.Angle\n\ni = pymeeus.Angle.Angle(11.94524)\n\nIn this case, you are telling the Python interpreter that you want to\nuse the class ``Angle`` (with parameter '11.94524') from the module\n``Angle`` belonging to the library ``pymeeus``.\n\nThere is, however, a more practical (and common) way to handle modules\nusing the statement ``from  import ``. For instance:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\nfrom pymeeus.Angle import Angle\n   from pymeeus.Epoch import Epoch, JDE2000\n   from math import sin, cos, tan, acos, atan2, sqrt, radians, log10\n\nThis way is preferred because, among other reasons, only the required\ncomponents are loaded into memory instead of the whole module. Also, now\nthe component is directly added to your execution environment, which\nmeans that you no longer need to use the *dot* notation.\n\nTherefore, the script at the beginning would become:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\nfrom pymeeus.Epoch import Epoch\n\nmydate = Epoch(1992, 10, 13.0)\n\nMeta\n----\n\nAuthor: Dagoberto Salazar",
