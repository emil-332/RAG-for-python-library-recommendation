The following example will take a PostGIS `geometry(Point)` and use an external service to create a `geometry(PointZ)`.\n\nThe `Geometry()` constructor will convert a PostGIS `geometry` that has been passed as a parameter to the PL/Python function into one of its `plpygis` subclasses. A `Geometry` that is returned from the PL/Python function will automatically be converted back to a PostGIS `geometry`.\n\nThe function above can be called as part of an SQL query:\n\nDocumentation\n\nFull `plpygis` documentation is available at .",

  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to convert geometries between various formats such as WKB, WKT, EWKB, and GeoJSON within PostgreSQL PL/Python functions. With plpygis, developers can easily integrate spatial data processing capabilities into their PostGIS databases by creating custom PL/Python functions that manipulate geometric data in a flexible and efficient manner."
