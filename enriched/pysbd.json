Support for more languages will be released soon.\n\n-   Use `pysbd` as a [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines) pipeline component. (recommended)Please refer to example [pysbd\\_as\\_spacy\\_component.py](https://github.com/nipunsadvilkar/pySBD/blob/master/examples/pysbd_as_spacy_component.py)\n- Use pysbd through [entrypoints](https://spacy.io/usage/saving-loading#entry-points-components)\n\nContributing\n\nIf you want to contribute new feature/language support or found a text that is incorrectly segmented using pySBD, then please head to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nipunsadvilkar/pySBD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to know more and follow these steps.\n\n1.  Fork it ( https://github.com/nipunsadvilkar/pySBD/fork )\n2.  Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\n4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n5.  Create a new Pull Request\n\nCitation\nIf you use `pysbd` package in your projects or research, please cite [PySBD: Pragmatic Sentence Boundary Disambiguation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlposs-1.15).\n\nCredit\n\nThis project wouldn't be possible without the great work done by [Pragmatic Segmenter](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter) team.",

  "usage_description": "This library is used to detect sentence boundaries in text across multiple languages using a rule-based approach, allowing developers to accurately identify sentences and use this information for various natural language processing tasks. By leveraging pysbd, developers can improve the accuracy of their NLP applications and enable features such as automatic summarization, question answering, and more."
