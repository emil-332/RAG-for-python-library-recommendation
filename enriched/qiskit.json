The essential parts of a quantum program are:\n1. Define and build a quantum circuit that represents the quantum state\n2. Define the classical output by measurements or a set of observable operators\n3. Depending on the output, use the Sampler primitive to sample outcomes or the Estimator primitive to estimate expectation values.\n\nCreate an example quantum circuit using the `QuantumCircuit` class:\n\nThis simple example creates an entangled state known as a [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state) $(|000\\rangle + i|111\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$. It uses the standard quantum gates: Hadamard gate (`h`), Phase gate (`p`), and CNOT gate (`cx`).\n\nOnce you've made your first quantum circuit, choose which primitive you will use. Starting with the Sampler,\nwe use `measure_all(inplace=False)` to get a copy of the circuit in which all the qubits are measured:\n\nRunning this will give an outcome similar to `{'000': 497, '111': 503}` which is `000` 50% of the time and `111` 50% of the time up to statistical fluctuations.\nTo illustrate the power of the Estimator, we now use the quantum information toolbox to create the operator $XXY+XYX+YXX-YYY$ and pass it to the `run()` function, along with our quantum circuit. Note that the Estimator requires a circuit _**without**_ measurements, so we use the `qc` circuit we created earlier.\n\nRunning this will give the outcome `4`. For fun, try to assign a value of +/- 1 to each single-qubit operator X and Y \nand see if you can achieve this outcome. (Spoiler alert: this is not possible!)",

      "text": "Using the Qiskit-provided `qiskit.primitives.StatevectorSampler` and `qiskit.primitives.StatevectorEstimator` will not take you very far.\nThe power of quantum computing cannot be simulated on classical computers and you need to use real quantum hardware to scale to larger quantum circuits.\nHowever, running a quantum circuit on hardware requires rewriting to the basis gates and connectivity of the quantum hardware.\nThe tool that does this is the [transpiler](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit/transpiler), and Qiskit includes transpiler passes for synthesis, optimization, mapping, and scheduling.\nHowever, it also includes a default compiler, which works very well in most examples.\nThe following code will map the example circuit to the `basis_gates = [\"cz\", \"sx\", \"rz\"]` and a linear chain of qubits $0 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2$ with the `coupling_map = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]`.\n\nExecuting your code on real quantum hardware\n\nQiskit provides an abstraction layer that lets users run quantum circuits on hardware from any vendor that provides a compatible interface. \nThe best way to use Qiskit is with a runtime environment that provides optimized implementations of Sampler and Estimator for a given hardware platform. This runtime may involve using pre- and post-processing, such as optimized transpiler passes with error suppression, error mitigation, and, eventually, error correction built in. A runtime implements `qiskit.primitives.BaseSamplerV2` and `qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimatorV2` interfaces. For example,\nsome packages that provide implementations of a runtime primitive implementation are:\n\n* https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime\n\nQiskit also provides a lower-level abstract interface for describing quantum backends. This interface, located in\n``qiskit.providers``, defines an abstract `BackendV2` class that providers can implement to represent their\nhardware or simulators to Qiskit. The backend class includes a common interface for executing circuits on the backends; however, in this interface each provider may perform different types of pre- and post-processing and return outcomes that are vendor-defined. Some examples of published provider packages that interface with real hardware are:\n\n* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-ionq\n* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-aqt-provider\n* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-braket-provider\n* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-quantinuum-provider\n* https://github.com/rigetti/qiskit-rigetti\n\nYou can refer to the documentation of these packages for further instructions\non how to get access and use these systems.\n\nContribution Guidelines\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to Qiskit, please take a look at our\n[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
