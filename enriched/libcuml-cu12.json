      "text": "&nbsp;cuML - GPU Machine Learning Algorithms\n\ncuML is a suite of libraries that implement machine learning algorithms and mathematical primitives functions that share compatible APIs with other [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) projects.\n\ncuML enables data scientists, researchers, and software engineers to run\ntraditional tabular ML tasks on GPUs without going into the details of CUDA\nprogramming. In most cases, cuML's Python API matches the API from\n[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org).\n\nFor large datasets, these GPU-based implementations can complete 10-50x faster\nthan their CPU equivalents. For details on performance, see the [cuML Benchmarks\nNotebook](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/tree/release/25.12/notebooks/tools).\n\nAs an example, the following Python snippet loads input and computes DBSCAN clusters, all on GPU, using cuDF:\n\nOutput:\n\ncuML also features multi-GPU and multi-node-multi-GPU operation, using [Dask](https://www.dask.org), for a\ngrowing list of algorithms. The following Python snippet reads input from a CSV file and performs\na NearestNeighbors query across a cluster of Dask workers, using multiple GPUs on a single node:\n\nInitialize a `LocalCUDACluster` configured with [UCXX](https://github.com/rapidsai/ucxx) for fast transport of CUDA arrays\n\nLoad data and perform `k-Nearest Neighbors` search. `cuml.dask` estimators also support `Dask.Array` as input:\n\nFor additional examples, browse our complete [API\ndocumentation](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuml/stable/), or check out our\nexample [walkthrough\nnotebooks](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/tree/release/25.12/notebooks). Finally, you\ncan find complete end-to-end examples in the [notebooks-contrib\nrepo](https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks-contrib).\n\nSupported Algorithms\nCategory\n---\n**Clustering**\nHierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)\nK-Means\nSingle-Linkage Agglomerative Clustering\nSpectral Clustering\n**Dimensionality Reduction**\nIncremental PCA\nTruncated Singular Value Decomposition (tSVD)\nUniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)\nRandom Projection\nt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (TSNE)\nSpectral Embedding\n**Linear Models for Regression or Classification**\nLinear Regression with Lasso or Ridge Regularization\nElasticNet Regression\nLARS Regression\nLogistic Regression\nNaive Bayes\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Coordinate Descent (CD), and Quasi-Newton (QN) (including L-BFGS and OWL-QN) solvers for linear models\n**Nonlinear Models for Regression or Classification**\nRandom Forest (RF) Regression\nInference for decision tree-based models\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression\nSupport Vector Machine Classifier (SVC)\nEpsilon-Support Vector Regression (SVR)\n**Preprocessing**\n**Time Series**\nAuto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)\n**Model Explanation**\nSHAP Permutation Explainer\n**Execution device interoperability**\n**Other**\n\n---\n\nInstallation\n\nSee [the RAPIDS Release Selector](https://docs.rapids.ai/install#selector) for\nthe command line to install either nightly or official release cuML packages\nvia conda, pip, or Docker.\n\nBuild/Install from Source\nSee the build [guide](BUILD.md).\n\nScikit-learn Compatibility\n\ncuML is compatible with scikit-learn version 1.4 or higher.\n\nContributing\n\nPlease see our [guide for contributing to cuML](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nReferences\n\nThe RAPIDS team has a number of blogs with deeper technical dives and examples.
