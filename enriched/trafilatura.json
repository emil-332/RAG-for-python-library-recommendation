It includes all necessary\ndiscovery and text processing components to perform **web crawling,\ndownloads, scraping, and extraction** of main texts, metadata and\ncomments. It aims at staying **handy and modular**: no database is\nrequired, the output can be converted to commonly used formats.\n\nGoing from HTML bulk to essential parts can alleviate many problems\nrelated to text quality, by **focusing on the actual content**,\n**avoiding the noise** caused by recurring elements like headers and footers\nand by **making sense of the data and metadata** with selected information.\nThe extractor strikes a balance between limiting noise (precision) and\nincluding all valid parts (recall). It is **robust and reasonably fast**.\n\nTrafilatura is [widely used](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/used-by.html)\nand integrated into [thousands of projects](https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura/network/dependents>)\nby companies like HuggingFace, IBM, and Microsoft Research as well as institutions like\nthe Allen Institute, Stanford, the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and\nthe University of Munich.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Advanced web crawling and text discovery:\n   - Support for sitemaps (TXT, XML) and feeds (ATOM, JSON, RSS)\n   - Smart crawling and URL management (filtering and deduplication)\n\n- Parallel processing of online and offline input:\n   - Live URLs, efficient and polite processing of download queues\n   - Previously downloaded HTML files and parsed HTML trees\n\n- Robust and configurable extraction of key elements:\n   - Main text (common patterns and generic algorithms like jusText and readability)\n   - Metadata (title, author, date, site name, categories and tags)\n   - Formatting and structure: paragraphs, titles, lists, quotes, code, line breaks, in-line text formatting\n   - Optional elements: comments, links, images, tables\n\n- Multiple output formats:\n   - TXT and Markdown\n   - CSV\n   - JSON\n   - HTML, XML and [XML-TEI](https://tei-c.org/)\n\n- Optional add-ons:\n   - Language detection on extracted content\n   - Speed optimizations\n\n- Actively maintained with support from the open-source community:\n   - Regular updates, feature additions, and optimizations\n   - Comprehensive documentation\n\nEvaluation and alternatives\n\nTrafilatura consistently outperforms other open-source libraries in text\nextraction benchmarks, showcasing its efficiency and accuracy in\nextracting web content. The extractor tries to strike a balance between\nlimiting noise and including all valid parts.\n\nFor more information see the [benchmark section](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/evaluation.html)\nand the [evaluation readme](https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura/blob/master/tests/README.rst)\nto run the evaluation with the latest data and packages.\n\nOther evaluations:\n\n- Most efficient open-source library in *ScrapingHub*'s [article extraction benchmark](https://github.com/scrapinghub/article-extraction-benchmark)\n- Best overall tool according to [Bien choisir son outil d'extraction de contenu à partir du Web](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02768510v3/document)\n  (Lejeune & Barbaresi 2020)\n- Best single tool by ROUGE-LSum Mean F1 Page Scores in [An Empirical Comparison of Web Content Extraction Algorithms](https://webis.de/downloads/publications/papers/bevendorff_2023b.pdf)\n  (Bevendorff et al. 2023)\n\nUsage and documentation\n\n[Getting started with Trafilatura](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)\nis straightforward.

Initially launched to create text databases for research purposes\nat the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (DWDS and ZDL units),\nthis package continues to be maintained but its future development\ndepends on community support.\n\n**If you value this software or depend on it for your product, consider\nsponsoring it and contributing to its codebase**. Your support will\nhelp maintain and enhance this popular package, ensuring its growth,\nrobustness, and accessibility for developers and users around the world.\n\n*Trafilatura* is an Italian word for [wire\ndrawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_drawing) symbolizing the\nrefinement and conversion process. It is also the way shapes of pasta\nare formed.\n\nAuthor\n\nReach out via ia the software repository or the [contact\npage](https://adrien.barbaresi.eu/) for inquiries, collaborations, or\nfeedback.
