      "text": "Panel: The powerful data exploration & web app framework for Python\n\nPanel is an [open-source](https://github.com/holoviz/panel/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) Python library that lets you **easily build powerful tools, dashboards and complex applications entirely in Python**. It has a batteries-included philosophy, putting the PyData ecosystem, powerful data tables and much more at your fingertips. High-level reactive APIs and lower-level callback based APIs ensure you can quickly build exploratory applications, but you aren't limited if you build complex, multi-page apps with rich interactivity. Panel is a member of the [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/) ecosystem, your gateway into a connected ecosystem of data exploration tools.\n\n---\n\nEnjoying Panel?

Panel also works with the [ipywidgets](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/panes/IPyWidget.html) ecosystem.\n\n(https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/index.html#panes)\n\nPanel provides bi-directional communication making it possible to react to clicks, selections, hover etc. events.\n\n(https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/panes/Vega.html)\n\nYou can develop in [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) as well as editors like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/).\n\n  \n  \n \n\nPanel provides a unique combination of deployment options. You can share your data and models as\n\n- a web application running on the [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) (default), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [Fast API](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web server.\n- a stand alone client side application powered by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) or [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) via [`panel convert`](https://panel.holoviz.org/how_to/wasm/convert.html).\n- an interactive Jupyter notebook component.\n- a static `.html` web page, a `.gif` video, a `.png` image and more.\n\nPanel has something to offer for every one *from beginner to data pro*.\n\nPanel is a member of the HoloViz ecosystem\n\nPanel is a member of the ambitious [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/) dataviz ecosystem and has first class support for the other members like [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org) (simple .hvplot plotting api), [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/) (powerful plotting api), and [Datashader](https://datashader.org/) (big data viz).\n\nPanel is built on top of [Param](https://param.holoviz.org). Param enables you to annotate your code with parameter ranges, documentation, and dependencies between parameters and code. With this approach,\n\n- you don't ever have to commit to whether your code will be used in a notebook, a data app, in batch processing, or reports.\n- you will write less code and be able to develop large, maintainable code bases!\n\nMini getting-started\n\nHead over to the [getting started guide](https://panel.holoviz.org/getting_started/index.html) for more!\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\nPanel can be installed on Linux, Windows, or Mac with ``conda``:\n\nor with ``pip``:\n\nSee the [Environments](#environments) section below for additional instructions for your environment.\n\nInteractive data apps\n\nBring your data or model\n\nBind it to a Panel *widget* and *lay it out*.\n\nFor deployment on a web server wrap it in a nice template.\n\nStart the server with\n\nor\n\nExamples\n\n(https://panel.holoviz.org/gallery/index.html)\n\n(https://holoviz-topics.github.io/panel-chat-examples/)\n\n(https://www.awesome-panel.org)\n\n(https://examples.holoviz.org)\n\nGet started\n\nDevelop applications in your favorite notebook or editor environment, including Jupyter(Lab) notebooks, VSCode, Google Colab and many more, [see our getting started guide](https://panel.holoviz.org/getting_started/installation.html#developing-in-different-editors) for more details.\n\nSupport & Feedback\n\nFor more detail check out the [HoloViz Community Guide](https://holoviz.org/community.html).\n\nContributing ️\n\nCheck out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.MD).\n\nLicense\n\nPanel is completely free and open-source.
