Given that \n   floating-point numbers are very slightly lossy, you should be aware of\n   any inaccuracies that this might cause.\n\n   TLDR: Do not use this in\n   `navigation algorithms guiding probes into the atmosphere of extraterrestrial worlds `_.\n\n- Documentation for python-measurement is available an\n  `ReadTheDocs `_.\n- Please post issues on\n  `Github `_.\n- Test status available on\n  `Travis-CI `_.\n\n.. image:: https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/coddingtonbear/python-measurement/trend.png\n\n   :target: https://bitdeli.com/free",

  "usage_description": "This library is used to create and manipulate unit-aware measurements in various physical units, including distance, area, energy, speed, temperature, time, volume, and weight. With this library, developers can easily convert between different measurement units and perform arithmetic operations on these values."
