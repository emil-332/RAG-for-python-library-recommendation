See the [kornia documentation](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more detail about the API for python functions and objects exposed by the `kornia-rs` Python module.\n\nThe `kornia-rs` library is thread-safe for use under the free-threaded Python build.\n\nSystem Dependencies (Optional)\n\nDepending on the features you want to use, you might need to install the following dependencies in your system:\n\nv4l (Video4Linux camera support)\n\nturbojpeg\n\ngstreamer\n\n**Note:** Check the [gstreamer installation guide](https://docs.rs/gstreamer/latest/gstreamer/#installation) for more details.\n\nExamples: Image Processing\n\nThe following example shows how to read an image, convert it to grayscale and resize it. The image is then logged to a [`rerun`](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun) recording stream for visualization.\n\nFor more examples and use cases, check out the [`examples`](https://github.com/kornia/kornia-rs/tree/main/examples) directory, which includes:\n- Image processing operations (resize, rotate, normalize, filters)\n- Video capture and processing\n- AprilTag detection\n- Feature detection (FAST)\n- Visual language models (VLM) integration\n- And more...\n\nPython Usage\n\nReading Images\n\nLoad an image, which is converted directly to a numpy array to ease the integration with other libraries.\n\nWriting Images\n\nWrite an image to disk:\n\nEncoding and Decoding\n\nEncode or decode image streams using the `turbojpeg` backend:\n\nImage Resizing\n\nResize an image using the `kornia-rs` backend with SIMD acceleration:\n\n‍ Development\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have `rust` and `python3` installed on your system.\n\nSetting Up Your Development Environment\n\n1. **Install Rust** using rustup:\n   \n\n2. **Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** to manage Python dependencies:\n   \n\n3. **Install [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)** command runner for managing development tasks:\n   \n\n4. **Clone the repository** to your local directory:\n\nAvailable Commands\n\nYou can check all available development commands by running `just` in the root directory of the project:\n\nDevelopment Container\n\nThis project includes a development container configuration for a consistent development environment across different machines.\n\n**Using the Dev Container:**\n\n1. Install the `Remote - Containers` extension in Visual Studio Code\n2. Open the project folder in VS Code\n3. Press `F1` and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`\n4. VS Code will build and open the project in the containerized environment\n\nThe devcontainer includes all necessary dependencies and tools for building and testing `kornia-rs`.\n\nRust Development\n\nCompile the project and run all tests:\n\nTo run specific tests:\n\nTo run clippy linting:\n\nPython Development\n\nBuild Python wheels using `maturin`:\n\nRun Python tests:\n\nContributing\n\nWe welcome contributions! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for:\n- Coding standards and style guidelines\n- Development workflow\n- How to run local checks before submitting PRs\n\nCommunity\n\nThis is a child project of [Kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia).\n\nCitation\n\nIf you use kornia-rs in your research, please cite:",
