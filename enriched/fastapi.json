Some of them are getting integrated into the core **Windows** product and some **Office** products._\"\n\nKabir Khan - Microsoft (ref)\n\n---\n\n\"_We adopted the **FastAPI** library to spawn a **REST** server that can be queried to obtain **predictions**.

[built with **FastAPI**]_\"\n\nKevin Glisson, Marc Vilanova, Forest Monsen - Netflix (ref)\n\n---\n\n\"_I’m over the moon excited about **FastAPI**. It’s so fun!_\"\n\nBrian Okken - Python Bytes podcast host (ref)\n\n---\n\n\"_Honestly, what you've built looks super solid and polished. In many ways, it's what I wanted **Hug** to be - it's really inspiring to see someone build that._\"\n\nTimothy Crosley - Hug creator (ref)\n\n---\n\n\"_If you're looking to learn one **modern framework** for building REST APIs, check out **FastAPI** [...] It's fast, easy to use and easy to learn [...]_\"\n\n\"_We've switched over to **FastAPI** for our **APIs** [...] I think you'll like it [...]_\"\n\nInes Montani - Matthew Honnibal - Explosion AI founders - spaCy creators (ref) - (ref)\n\n---\n\n\"_If anyone is looking to build a production Python API, I would highly recommend **FastAPI**. It is **beautifully designed**, **simple to use** and **highly scalable**, it has become a **key component** in our API first development strategy and is driving many automations and services such as our Virtual TAC Engineer._\"\n\nDeon Pillsbury - Cisco (ref)\n\n---\n\n**Typer**, the FastAPI of CLIs\n\nIf you are building a CLI app to be used in the terminal instead of a web API, check out **Typer**.\n\n**Typer** is FastAPI's little sibling. And it's intended to be the **FastAPI of CLIs**. ⌨️\n\nRequirements\n\nFastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants:\n\n* Starlette for the web parts.\n* Pydantic for the data parts.\n\nInstallation\n\nCreate and activate a virtual environment and then install FastAPI:\n\n**Note**: Make sure you put `\"fastapi[standard]\"` in quotes to ensure it works in all terminals.\n\nExample\n\nCreate it\n\nCreate a file `main.py` with:\n\nOr use async def...\n\nIf your code uses `async` / `await`, use `async def`:\n\n**Note**:\n\nIf you don't know, check the _\"In a hurry?\"_ section about `async` and `await` in the docs.\n\nRun it\n\nRun the server with:\n\nAbout the command fastapi dev main.py...\n\nThe command `fastapi dev` reads your `main.py` file, detects the **FastAPI** app in it, and starts a server using Uvicorn.\n\nBy default, `fastapi dev` will start with auto-reload enabled for local development.\n\nYou can read more about it in the FastAPI CLI docs.\n\nCheck it\n\nOpen your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery.\n\nYou will see the JSON response as:\n\nYou already created an API that:",

You can deploy FastAPI apps to any cloud provider you choose.\n\nFollow your cloud provider's guides to deploy FastAPI apps with them.\n\nPerformance\n\nIndependent TechEmpower benchmarks show **FastAPI** applications running under Uvicorn as one of the fastest Python frameworks available, only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI). (*)\n\nTo understand more about it, see the section Benchmarks.\n\nDependencies\n\nFastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette.\n\n`standard` Dependencies\n\nWhen you install FastAPI with `pip install \"fastapi[standard]\"` it comes with the `standard` group of optional dependencies:\n\nUsed by Pydantic:\n\n* email-validator - for email validation.\n\nUsed by Starlette:\n\n* httpx - Required if you want to use the `TestClient`.\n* jinja2 - Required if you want to use the default template configuration.\n* python-multipart - Required if you want to support form \"parsing\", with `request.form()`.\n\nUsed by FastAPI:\n\n* uvicorn - for the server that loads and serves your application. This includes `uvicorn[standard]`, which includes some dependencies (e.g. `uvloop`) needed for high performance serving.\n* `fastapi-cli[standard]` - to provide the `fastapi` command.\n\nWithout `standard` Dependencies\n\nIf you don't want to include the `standard` optional dependencies, you can install with `pip install fastapi` instead of `pip install \"fastapi[standard]\"`.\n\nWithout `fastapi-cloud-cli`\n\nIf you want to install FastAPI with the standard dependencies but without the `fastapi-cloud-cli`, you can install with `pip install \"fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]\"`.\n\nAdditional Optional Dependencies\n\nThere are some additional dependencies you might want to install.\n\nAdditional optional Pydantic dependencies:\n\n* pydantic-settings - for settings management.\n* pydantic-extra-types - for extra types to be used with Pydantic.\n\nAdditional optional FastAPI dependencies:",
