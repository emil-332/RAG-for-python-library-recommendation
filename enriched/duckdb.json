It has zero external dependencies and runs in-process in its host application or as a single binary.\n* **Portable**: DuckDB runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS and all popular hardware architectures. It has idiomatic client APIs for major programming languages.\n* **Feature-rich**: DuckDB offers a rich SQL dialect. It can read and write file formats such as CSV, Parquet, and JSON, to and from the local file system and remote endpoints such as S3 buckets.\n* **Fast**: DuckDB runs analytical queries at blazing speed thanks to its columnar engine, which supports parallel execution and can process larger-than-memory workloads.\n* **Extensible**: DuckDB is extensible by third-party features such as new data types, functions, file formats and new SQL syntax. User contributions are available as community extensions.\n* **Free**: DuckDB and its core extensions are open-source under the permissive MIT License. The intellectual property of the project is held by the DuckDB Foundation.\n\nInstallation\n\nInstall the latest release of DuckDB directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/duckdb/):\n\nInstall with all optional dependencies:\n\nContributing\n\nSee the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to set up a development environment.",
