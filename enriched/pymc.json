Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a\nlarge suite of problems.\n\nCheck out the `PyMC overview `__,  or\none of `the many examples `__!\nFor questions on PyMC, head on over to our `PyMC Discourse `__ forum.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n-  Intuitive model specification syntax, for example, ``x ~ N(0,1)``\n   translates to ``x = Normal('x',0,1)``\n-  **Powerful sampling algorithms**, such as the `No U-Turn\n   Sampler `__, allow complex models\n   with thousands of parameters with little specialized knowledge of\n   fitting algorithms.\n-  **Variational inference**: `ADVI `__\n   for fast approximate posterior estimation as well as mini-batch ADVI\n   for large data sets.\n-  Relies on `PyTensor `__ which provides:\n-  Transparent support for missing value imputation\n\nLinear Regression Example\n==========================\n\nPlant growth can be influenced by multiple factors, and understanding these relationships is crucial for optimizing agricultural practices.\n\nImagine we conduct an experiment to predict the growth of a plant based on different environmental variables.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\nimport pymc as pm\n\n# Taking draws from a normal distribution\n   seed = 42\n   x_dist = pm.Normal.dist(shape=(100, 3))\n   x_data = pm.draw(x_dist, random_seed=seed)\n\n# Independent Variables:\n   # Sunlight Hours: Number of hours the plant is exposed to sunlight daily.\n   # Water Amount: Daily water amount given to the plant (in milliliters).\n   # Soil Nitrogen Content: Percentage of nitrogen content in the soil.\n\n# Dependent Variable:\n   # Plant Growth (y): Measured as the increase in plant height (in centimeters) over a certain period.\n\n# Define coordinate values for all dimensions of the data\n   coords={\n   }\n\n# Define generative model\n   with pm.Model(coords=coords) as generative_model:\n\n# Generating data from model by fixing parameters\n   fixed_parameters = {\n   }\n   with pm.do(generative_model, fixed_parameters) as synthetic_model:\n\n# Infer parameters conditioned on observed data\n   with pm.observe(generative_model, {\"plant growth\": synthetic_y}) as inference_model:\n\nFrom the summary, we can see that the mean of the inferred parameters are very close to the fixed parameters\n\n=====================  ======  =====  ========  =========  ===========  =========  ==========  ==========  =======\nParams                  mean     sd    hdi_3%    hdi_97%    mcse_mean    mcse_sd    ess_bulk    ess_tail    r_hat\n=====================  ======  =====  ========  =========  ===========  =========  ==========  ==========  =======\nbetas[sunlight hours]   4.972  0.054     4.866      5.066        0.001      0.001        3003        1257        1\nbetas[water amount]    19.963  0.051    19.872     20.062        0.001      0.001        3112        1658        1\nbetas[soil nitrogen]    1.994  0.055     1.899      2.107        0.001      0.001        3221        1559        1\nsigma                   0.511  0.037     0.438      0.575        0.001      0            2945        1522        1\n=====================  ======  =====  ========  =========  ===========  =========  ==========  ==========  =======\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n# Simulate new data conditioned on inferred parameters\n   new_x_data = pm.draw(\n   )\n   new_coords = coords | {\"trial\": [0, 1, 2]}\n\nwith inference_model:\n\npm.stats.summary(idata.predictions, kind=\"stats\")\n\nThe new data conditioned on inferred parameters would look like:\n\n================ ======== ======= ======== =========\nOutput            mean     sd      hdi_3%   hdi_97%\n================ ======== ======= ======== =========\nplant growth[0]   14.229   0.515   13.325   15.272\nplant growth[1]   24.418   0.511   23.428   25.326\nplant growth[2]   -6.747   0.511   -7.740   -5.797\n================ ======== ======= ======== =========\n\n.. code-block:: python",
