Forward defines how the LightningModule behaves during inference/prediction.**\n\nStep 3: Train!\n\nAdvanced features\n\nLightning has over [40+ advanced features](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html#trainer-flags) designed for professional AI research at scale.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n  \n\n  Highlighted feature code snippets\n\nTrain on TPUs without code changes\n\n16-bit precision\n\nExperiment managers\n\nEarlyStopping\n\nCheckpointing\n\nExport to torchscript (JIT) (production use)\n\nExport to ONNX (production use)\n\nPro-level control of optimization (advanced users)\n\nFor complex/professional level work, you have optional full control of the optimizers.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nAdvantages over unstructured PyTorch\n\n- Models become hardware agnostic\n- Code is clear to read because engineering code is abstracted away\n- Easier to reproduce\n- Make fewer mistakes because lightning handles the tricky engineering\n- Keeps all the flexibility (LightningModules are still PyTorch modules), but removes a ton of boilerplate\n- Lightning has dozens of integrations with popular machine learning tools.\n- [Tested rigorously with every new PR](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/tree/master/tests). We test every combination of PyTorch and Python supported versions, every OS, multi GPUs and even TPUs.\n- Minimal running speed overhead (about 300 ms per epoch compared with pure PyTorch).\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nExamples\n\nSelf-supervised Learning\n\nConvolutional Architectures\n\n- [GPT-2](https://lightning-bolts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/convolutional.html#gpt-2)\n- [UNet](https://lightning-bolts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/convolutional.html#unet)\n\nReinforcement Learning\n\nGANs\n\n- [Basic GAN](https://lightning-bolts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/gans.html#basic-gan)\n- [DCGAN](https://lightning-bolts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/gans.html#dcgan)\n\nClassic ML\n\n- [Logistic Regression](https://lightning-bolts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/classic_ml.html#logistic-regression)\n- [Linear Regression](https://lightning-bolts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/classic_ml.html#linear-regression)\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nCommunity\n\nThe PyTorch Lightning community is maintained by\n\n- [10+ core contributors](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/community/governance.html) who are all a mix of professional engineers, Research Scientists, and Ph.D. students from top AI labs.\n- 680+ active community contributors.\n\nWant to help us build Lightning and reduce boilerplate for thousands of researchers? [Learn how to make your first contribution here](https://medium.com/pytorch-lightning/quick-contribution-guide-86d977171b3a)\n\nPyTorch Lightning is also part of the [PyTorch ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) which requires projects to have solid testing, documentation and support.\n\nAsking for help\n\nIf you have any questions please:\n\n1.
