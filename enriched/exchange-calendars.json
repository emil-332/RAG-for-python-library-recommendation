If you still can't find the calendar you're looking for, [create a new one](#How-can-I-create-a-new-calendar)!\n\nInstallation\n\nQuick Start\n\nGet a list of available calendars:\n\nGet a calendar:\n\nQuery the schedule:\n\nWorking with **sessions**\n\nSee the [sessions tutorial](docs/tutorials/sessions.ipynb) for a deeper dive into sessions.\n\nWorking with **minutes**\n\nCheck out the [minutes tutorial](docs/tutorials/minutes.ipynb) for a deeper dive that includes an explanation of the concept of 'minutes' and how the \"side\" option determines which minutes are treated as trading minutes.\n\nTutorials\n* [sessions.ipynb](docs/tutorials/sessions.ipynb) - all things [sessions](#Working-with-sessions).\n* [minutes.ipynb](docs/tutorials/minutes.ipynb) - all things [minutes](#Working-with-minutes). Don't miss this one!\n* [calendar_properties.ipynb](docs/tutorials/calendar_properties.ipynb) - calendar constrution and a walk through the schedule and all other calendar properties.\n* [calendar_methods.ipynb](docs/tutorials/calendar_methods.ipynb) - a walk through all the methods available to interrogate a calendar.\n* [trading_index.ipynb](docs/tutorials/trading_index.ipynb) - a method that warrants a tutorial all of its own.\n\nHopefully you'll find that `exchange_calendars` has the method you need to get the information you want. If it doesn't, either [PR](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars/pulls) it or [raise an issue](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars/issues) and let us know!\n\nCommand Line Usage\nPrint a unix-cal like calendar straight from the command line (holidays are indicated by brackets)...\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n**How can I create a new calendar?**\n\nFirst off, make sure the calendar you're after hasn't already been defined; exchange calendars comes with over [50 pre-defined calendars](#Calendars), including major security exchanges.\n\nIf you can't find what you're after, a custom calendar can be created as a subclass of [ExchangeCalendar](exchange_calendars/exchange_calendar.py). [This workflow](.github/pull_request_template.md) describes the process to add a new calendar to `exchange_calendars`. Just follow the relevant parts.\n\nTo access the new calendar via `get_calendar` call either `xcals.register_calendar` or `xcals.register_calendar_type` to register, respectively, a specific calendar instance or a calendar factory (i.e. the subclass).\n\n**Can I contribute a new calendar to exchange calendars?**\n\nYes please! The workflow can be found [here](.github/pull_request_template.md).\n\n**`` is missing a holiday, has a wrong time, should have a break etc...**\n\n**All** of the exchange calendars are maintained by user contributions. If a calendar you care about needs revising, please open a [PR](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars/pulls) - that's how this thing works! (Never contributed to a project before and it all seems a bit daunting? Check [this out](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/README.md) and don't look back!)\n\nYou'll find the workflow to modify an existing calendar [here](.github/pull_request_template.md).\n\n**What times are considered open and closed?**\n\n`exchange_calendars` attempts to be broadly useful by considering an exchange to be open only during periods of regular trading. During any pre-trading, post-trading or auction period the exchange is treated as closed. An exchange is also treated as closed during any observed lunch break.\n\nSee the [minutes tutorial](docs/tutorials/minutes.ipynb) for a detailed explanation of which minutes an exchange is considered open over. If you previously used `trading_calendars`, or `exchange_calendars` prior to release 3.4, then this is the place to look for answers to questions of how the definition of trading minutes has changed over time (and is now stable and flexible!).\n\nCalendars",
