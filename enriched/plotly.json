Plotly graphs can be viewed in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org), other Python notebook software such as [marimo](https://marimo.io), as standalone HTML files, or integrated into [Dash applications](https://dash.plotly.com/).\n\n[Contact us](https://plotly.com/consulting-and-oem/) for consulting, dashboard development, application integration, and feature additions.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nInstallation\n\nplotly.py may be installed using pip\n\nor conda.\n\nJupyter Widget Support\n\nFor use as a Jupyter widget, install `jupyter` and `anywidget`\npackages using `pip`:\n\nor `conda`:\n\nStatic Image Export\n\nplotly.py supports [static image export](https://plotly.com/python/static-image-export/),\nusing either the [`kaleido`](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido)\npackage (recommended, supported as of `plotly` version 4.9) or the [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca)\ncommand line utility (legacy as of `plotly` version 4.9).\n\nKaleido\n\nThe [`kaleido`](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido) package has no dependencies and can be installed\nusing pip\n\nor conda\n\nExtended Geo Support\n\nSome plotly.py features rely on fairly large geographic shape files. The county\nchoropleth figure factory is one such example. These shape files are distributed as a\nseparate `plotly-geo` package. This package can be installed using pip...\n\nor conda\n\n`plotly-geo` can be found on Github at https://github.com/plotly/plotly-geo.\n\nCopyright and Licenses\n\nCode and documentation copyright 2019 Plotly, Inc.\n\nCode released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).\n\nDocs released under the [Creative Commons license](https://github.com/plotly/documentation/blob/source/LICENSE).",
