      "text": "Albucore: High-Performance Image Processing Functions\n\nAlbucore is a library of optimized atomic functions designed for efficient image processing. These functions serve as the foundation for [AlbumentationsX](https://github.com/albumentations-team/AlbumentationsX), a popular image augmentation library.\n\nOverview\n\nImage processing operations can be implemented in various ways, each with its own performance characteristics depending on the image type, size, and number of channels. Albucore aims to provide the fastest implementation for each operation by leveraging different backends such as NumPy, OpenCV, and custom optimized code.\n\nKey features:\n\n- Optimized atomic image processing functions\n- Automatic selection of the fastest implementation based on input image characteristics\n- Seamless integration with Albumentations\n- Extensive benchmarking for performance validation\n\nGitAds Sponsored\n(https://gitads.dev/v1/ad-track?source=albumentations-team/albucore@github)\n\nInstallation\n\nUsage\n\nAlbucore automatically selects the most efficient implementation based on the input image type and characteristics.\n\nShape Conventions\n\nAlbucore expects images to follow specific shape conventions, with the channel dimension always present:\n\n- **Single image**: `(H, W, C)` - Height, Width, Channels\n- **Grayscale image**: `(H, W, 1)` - Height, Width, 1 channel\n- **Batch of images**: `(N, H, W, C)` - Number of images, Height, Width, Channels\n- **3D volume**: `(D, H, W, C)` - Depth, Height, Width, Channels\n- **Batch of volumes**: `(N, D, H, W, C)` - Number of volumes, Depth, Height, Width, Channels\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n1. **Channel dimension is always required**, even for grayscale images (use shape `(H, W, 1)`)\n2. Single-channel images should have shape `(H, W, 1)` not `(H, W)`\n3. Batches and volumes are treated uniformly - a 4D array `(N, H, W, C)` can represent either a batch of images or a 3D volume\n\nExamples:\n\nFunctions\n\nAlbucore includes optimized implementations for various image processing operations, including:\n\n- Arithmetic operations (add, multiply, power)\n- Normalization (per-channel, global)\n- Geometric transformations (vertical flip, horizontal flip)\n- Helper decorators (to_float, to_uint8)\n\nBatch Processing\n\nMany functions in Albucore support batch processing out of the box. The library automatically handles different input shapes:\n\n- Single images: `(H, W, C)`\n- Batches: `(N, H, W, C)`\n- Volumes: `(D, H, W, C)`\n- Batch of volumes: `(N, D, H, W, C)`\n\nFunctions will preserve the input shape structure, applying operations efficiently across all images/slices in the batch.\n\nDecorators\n\nAlbucore provides several useful decorators:\n\n- `@preserve_channel_dim`: Ensures single-channel images maintain their shape `(H, W, 1)` when OpenCV operations might drop the channel dimension\n- `@contiguous`: Ensures arrays are C-contiguous for optimal performance\n- `@uint8_io` and `@float32_io`: Handle automatic type conversions for functions that work best with specific data types\n\nPerformance\n\nAlbucore uses a combination of techniques to achieve high performance:\n\n1. **Multiple Implementations**: Each function may have several implementations using different backends (NumPy, OpenCV, custom code).\n2. **Automatic Selection**: The library automatically chooses the fastest implementation based on the input image type, size, and number of channels.\n3. **Optimized Algorithms**: Custom implementations are optimized for specific use cases, often outperforming general-purpose libraries.\n\nLicense\n\nMIT\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAlbucore is part of the [AlbumentationsX](https://github.com/albumentations-team/AlbumentationsX) project.
