The stubs cover the most typical use cases of\npandas.  In general, these stubs are narrower than what is possibly allowed by pandas,\nbut follow a convention of suggesting best recommended practices for using pandas.\n\nThe stubs are likely incomplete in terms of covering the published API of pandas.  NOTE: The current 2.0.x releases of pandas-stubs do not support all of the new features of pandas 2.0.  See this [tracker](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/issues/624) to understand the current compatibility with version 2.0.\n\nThe stubs are tested with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright#readme) and are currently shipped with the Visual Studio Code extension\n[pylance](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release#readme).\n\nUsage\n\nLet’s take this example piece of code in file `round.py`\n\nMypy won't see any issues with that, but after installing pandas-stubs and running it again:\n\nwe get the following error message:\n\nAnd, if you use pyright:\n\nyou get the following error message:\n\nAnd after confirming with the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.round.html)\nwe can fix the code:\n\nVersion Numbering Convention\n\nThe version number x.y.z.yymmdd corresponds to a test done with pandas version x.y.z, with the stubs released on the date mm/yy/dd.\nIt is anticipated that the stubs will be released more frequently than pandas as the stubs are expected to evolve due to more\npublic visibility.\n\nWhere to get it\n\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: \n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-stubs) and on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).\n\nDependencies\n\n- [pandas: powerful Python data analysis toolkit](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n- [typing-extensions >= 4.2.0 - supporting the latest typing extensions](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions#readme)\n\nInstallation from sources\n\n- Make sure you have `python >= 3.10` installed.\n- Install poetry\n\n- Install the project dependencies\n\n- Build and install the distribution\n\nLicense\n\n[BSD 3](LICENSE)\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocumentation is a work-in-progress.\n\nBackground\n\nThese stubs are the result of a strategic effort led by the core pandas team to integrate [Microsoft type stub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs) with the [VirtusLabs pandas_stubs repository](https://github.com/VirtusLab/pandas-stubs).\n\nThese stubs were initially forked from the Microsoft project at  as of [this commit](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/tree/6b800063bde687cd1846122431e2a729a9de625a).\n\nWe are indebted to Microsoft and that project for providing the initial set of public type stubs.  We are also grateful for the original pandas-stubs project at , which created the framework for testing the stubs.\n\nDifferences between type declarations in pandas and pandas-stubs\n\nThe  project has type declarations for some parts of pandas, both for the internal and public API's.  Those type declarations are used to make sure that the pandas code is _internally_ consistent.\n\nThe  project provides type declarations for the pandas _public_ API.  The philosophy of these stubs can be found at . While it would be ideal if the `pyi` files in this project would be part of the `pandas` distribution, this would require consistency between the internal type declarations and the public declarations, and the scope of a project to create that consistency is quite large.  That is a long term goal.  Finally, another goal is to do more frequent releases of the pandas-stubs than is done for pandas, in order to make the stubs more useful.\n\nIf issues are found with the public stubs, pull requests to correct those issues are welcome.  In addition, pull requests on the pandas repository to fix the same issue are welcome there as well.  However, since the goals of typing in the two projects are different (internal consistency vs. public usage), it may be a challenge to create consistent type declarations across both projects.  See  for a discussion of typing standards used within the pandas code.\n\nGetting help\n\nAsk questions and report issues on the [pandas-stubs repository](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/issues).\n\nDiscussion and Development\n\nMost development discussions take place on GitHub in the [pandas-stubs repository](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/).\n\nFurther, the [pandas-dev mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pandas-dev) can also be used for specialized discussions or design issues, and a [Slack channel](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/community.html?highlight=slack#community-slack) is available for quick development related questions.\n\nThere are also frequent [community meetings](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/community.html#community-meeting) for project maintainers open to the community as well as monthly [new contributor meetings](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/community.html#new-contributor-meeting) to help support new contributors.\n\nAdditional information on the communication channels can be found on the [contributor community](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/community.html) page.\n\nContributing to pandas-stubs\n\nAll contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

  "usage_description": "This library is used to provide type annotations for pandas, enabling developers to write more maintainable and self-documenting code with precise type hints. By utilizing these type stubs, developers can ensure that their Python projects using pandas have robust static analysis and auto-completion capabilities in IDEs."
