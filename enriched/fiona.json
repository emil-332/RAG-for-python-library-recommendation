This project includes Python modules and a command line\ninterface (CLI).\n\nFiona depends on `GDAL `__ but is different from GDAL's own\n`bindings `__. Fiona is designed to\nbe highly productive and to make it easy to write code which is easy to read.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nFiona has several `extension modules\n`__ which link against\nlibgdal. This complicates installation. Binary distributions (wheels)\ncontaining libgdal and its own dependencies are available from the Python\nPackage Index and can be installed using pip.\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\nThese wheels are mainly intended to make installation easy for simple\napplications, not so much for production. They are not tested for compatibility\nwith all other binary wheels, conda packages, or QGIS, and omit many of GDAL's\noptional format drivers. If you need, for example, GML support you will need to\nbuild and install Fiona from a source distribution. It is possible to install\nFiona from source using pip (version >= 22.3) and the `--no-binary` option. A\nspecific GDAL installation can be selected by setting the GDAL_CONFIG\nenvironment variable.\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\nMany users find Anaconda and conda-forge a good way to install Fiona and get\naccess to more optional format drivers (like GML).\n\nFiona 1.10 requires Python 3.8 or higher and GDAL 3.4 or higher.\n\nPython Usage\n============\n\nFeatures are read from and written to file-like ``Collection`` objects returned\nfrom the ``fiona.open()`` function. Features are data classes modeled on the\nGeoJSON format. They don't have any spatial methods of their own, so if you\nwant to transform them you will need Shapely or something like it. Here is an\nexample of using Fiona to read some features from one data file, change their\ngeometry attributes using Shapely, and write them to a new data file.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\nCLI Usage\n=========\n\nFiona's command line interface, named \"fio\", is documented at `docs/cli.rst\n`__. The CLI has a\nnumber of different commands. Its ``fio cat`` command streams GeoJSON features\nfrom any dataset.\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nFor more details about this project, please see:\n\n* Fiona `home page `__\n* `Docs and manual `__\n* `Examples `__\n* Main `user discussion group `__\n* `Developers discussion group `__\n\nChanges\n=======\n\nAll issue numbers are relative to https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/issues.\n\n1.10.1 (2024-09-16)\n-------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Logging in the CRS class no longer tries to print representations of objects\n  that may be NULL when searching for authority matches (#1445).\n\n1.10.0 (2024-09-03)\n-------------------\n\nThe package version, credits, and citation file have been updated. There have\nbeen no other changes since 1.10.0rc1. Fiona is the work of 73 contributors,\nincluding 25 new contributors since 1.9.0.\n\n1.10.0rc1 (2024-08-21)\n----------------------\n\nThis is the first release candidate for 1.10.0.",

      "text": "Changes:\n\n- Mutable item access to Feature, Geometry, and Properties instances has been\n  restored (reported in #1430). This usage should be avoided as instances of\n  these classes will be immutable in a future version.\n- The setup.cfg duplicates project configuration in pyproject.toml and has been\n  removed.\n\n1.10b3 (2024-07-29)\n-------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- The sketchy, semi-private Python opener interfaces of version 1.10b2 have\n  been replaced by ABCs that are exported from fiona.abc (#1415).\n- The truncate VSI plugin callback has been implemented (#1413).\n\n1.10b2 (2024-07-10)\n-------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- The Pyopener registry and VSI plugin have been rewritten to avoid filename\n  conflicts and to be compatible with multithreading. Now, a new plugin handler\n  is registered for each instance of using an opener (#1408). Before GDAL 3.9.0\n  plugin handlers cannot not be removed and so it may be observed that the size\n  of the Pyopener registry grows during the execution of a program.\n- A CSLConstList ctypedef has been added and is used where appropriate (#1404).\n- Fiona model objects have a informative, printable representation again\n  (#1380).\n\nPackaging:\n\n- PyPI wheels include GDAL 3.9.1 and curl 8.8.0.\n\n1.10b1 (2024-04-16)\n-------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fiona can again set fields with values that are instances of classes derived\n  from date, time, and datetime (#1377).  This was broken by changes in 1.10a2.\n\n1.10a2 (2024-04-05)\n-------------------\n\nDeprecations:\n\n- The FIELD_TYPES, FIELD_TYPES_MAP, and FIELD_TYPES_MAP_REV attributes of\n  fiona.schema are no longer used by the project and will be removed in version\n  2.0 (#1366).\n- The Python style of rio-filter expressions introduced in version 1.0 are\n  deprecated. Only the parenthesized list type of expression will be supported\n  by version 2.0.\n\nNew features:\n\n- All supported Fiona field types are now represented by classes in\n  fiona.schema. These classes are mapped in FIELD_TYPES_MAP2 and\n  FIELD_TYPES_MAP2_REV to OGR field type and field subtype pairs (#1366).\n- The filter, map, and reduce CLI commands from the public domain version 1.1.0\n  of fio-planet have been incorporated into Fiona's core set of commands\n  (#1362).  These commands are only available if pyparsing and shapely (each of\n  these are declared in the \"calc\" set of extra requirements) are installed.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fiona's python opener VSI plugin prefix has been changed to \"vsifiopener\" to\n  not conflict with Rasterio (#1368).\n- Add a 16-bit integer type \"int16\" based on OGR's OSFTInt16 integer sub-type\n  (#1358).\n- Allow a GeoJSON collection's layer name to be set on opening in write mode\n  (#1352).\n- The legacy crs.py module which was shadowed by the new crs.pyx module has\n  been deleted (#1344).\n- Python 3.8 has been added back to the list of supported versions and\n  a dependency on Numpy added in 1.10a1 has been removed.\n- An implementation of the VSI flush callback has been added to _vsiopener.pyx.\n- Openers are now registered only by urlpath. The mode is no longer considered\n  as OGR drivers may use a mix of modes when creating a new dataset.\n\nOther changes:",

Additionally, members of that\nmodule are no longer exported from the top level module.\n\nNew features:\n\nPython openers can now support discovery of auxiliary \"sidecar\" files like\n.aux.xml, .msk, and .tfw files for GeoTIFFs (#1331). Additionally, filesystem\nobjects, such as those from fsspec, can be used as openers. This will become\nthe recommended usage, supplanting the use of single file openers.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Use of pkg_resources in test_rio_info.py has been eliminated.\n- gzip, tar, and zip archive URIs containing drive letters were not always\n  parsed properly on Windows, but are now (#1334).\n\n1.9.6 (2024-03-07)\n------------------\n\n- Ensure that geometry types in a schema are translated to a linear type, as\n  geometry instances are (#1313).\n- Fix broken stable API documentation on Read The Docs (#).\n- Remove install requirement of setuptools, a regression introduced in 1.9.5.\n\n1.9.5 (2023-10-11)\n------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Expand keys in schema mismatch exception, resolving #1278.\n- Preserve the null properties and geometry of a Feature when serializing\n  (#1276).\n\nPackaging:\n\n- The distribution name is now officially \"fiona\", not \"Fiona\". The import\n  name remains \"fiona\".\n- Builds now require Cython >= 3.0.2 (#1276).\n- PyPI wheels include GDAL 3.6.4, PROJ 9.0.1, and GEOS 3.11.2.\n- PyPI wheels include curl 8.4.0, addressing CVE-2023-38545 and CVE-38546.\n- PyPI wheels are now available for Python 3.12.\n\n1.9.4.post1 (2023-05-23)\n------------------------\n\nExtraneous files were unintentionally packaged in the 1.9.4 wheels. This post1\nrelease excludes them so that wheel contents are as in version 1.9.3.\n\n1.9.4 (2023-05-16)\n------------------\n\n- The performance of Feature.from_dict() has been improved (#1267).\n- Several sources of meaningless log messages from fiona._geometry about NULL\n  geometries are avoided (#1264).\n- The Parquet driver has been added to the list of supported drivers and will\n  be available if your system's GDAL library links libarrow. Note that fiona\n  wheels on PyPI do not include libarrow as it is rather large.\n- Ensure that fiona._vendor modules are found and included.\n- Bytes type feature properties are now hex encoded when serializing to GeoJSON\n  (#1263).\n- Docstrings for listdir and listlayers have been clarified and harmonized.\n- Nose style test cases have been converted to unittest.TestCase (#1256).\n- The munch package used by fio-filter and fio-calc is now vendored and patched\n  to remove usage of the deprecated pkg_resources module (#1255).\n\n1.9.3 (2023-04-10)\n------------------\n\n- Rasterio CRS objects are compatible with the Collection constructor and are\n  now accepted (#1248).\n- Enable append mode for fio-load (#1237).\n- Reading a GeoJSON with an empty array property can result in a segmentation\n  fault since version 1.9.0.

This helps prevent bugs when Collections are created\n  and then used later or in different scopes.\n- Missing GDAL support for TopoJSON, GeoJSONSeq, and ESRIJSON has been enabled\n  (#721).\n- A regression in handling of polygons with M values (#724) has been fixed.\n- Per-feature debug logging calls in OGRFeatureBuilder methods have been\n  eliminated to improve feature writing performance (#718).\n- Native support for datasets in Google Cloud Storage identified by \"gs\"\n  resource names has been added (#709).\n- Support has been added for triangle, polyhedral surface, and TIN geometry\n  types (#679).\n- Notes about using the MemoryFile and ZipMemoryFile classes has been added to\n  the manual (#674).\n\n1.8.4 (2018-12-10)\n------------------\n\n- 3D geometries can now be transformed with a specified precision (#523).\n- A bug producing a spurious DriverSupportError for Shapefiles with a \"time\"\n  field (#692) has been fixed.\n- Patching of the GDAL_DATA environment variable was accidentally left in place\n  in 1.8.3 and now has been removed.\n\n1.8.3 (2018-11-30)\n------------------\n\n- The RASTERIO_ENV config environment marker this project picked up from\n  Rasterio has been renamed to FIONA_ENV (#665).\n- Options --gdal-data and --proj-data have been added to the fio-env command so\n  that users of Rasterio wheels can get paths to set GDAL_DATA and PROJ_LIB\n  environment variables.\n- The unsuccessful attempt to make GDAL and PROJ support file discovery and\n  configuration automatic within collection's crs and crs_wkt properties has\n  been reverted.  Users must execute such code inside a `with Env()` block or\n  set the GDAL_DATA and PROJ_LIB environment variables needed by GDAL.\n\n1.8.2 (2018-11-19)\n------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Raise FionaValueError when an iterator's __next__ is called and the session\n  is found to be missing or inactive instead of passing a null pointer to\n  OGR_L_GetNextFeature (#687).\n\n1.8.1 (2018-11-15)\n------------------\n\nBug fixes:",

This fixes a bug reported to the Rasterio project\n  and which also existed in Fiona.\n- An unused import of the packaging module and the dependency have been \n  removed (#653).\n- The Env class logged to the 'rasterio' hierarchy instead of 'fiona'. This\n  mistake has been corrected (#646).\n- The Mapping abstract base class is imported from collections.abc when\n  possible (#647).\n\nRefactoring:\n\n- Standardization of the tests on pytest functions and fixtures continues and\n  is nearing completion (#648, #649, #650, #651, #652).\n\n1.8b1 (2018-10-15)\n------------------\n\nDeprecations:\n\n- Collection slicing has been deprecated and will be prohibited in a future\n  version.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Rasterio CRS objects passed to transform module methods will be converted\n  to dicts as needed (#590).\n- Implicitly convert curve geometries to their linear approximations rather\n  than failing (#617).\n- Migrated unittest test cases in test_collection.py and test_layer.py to the\n  use of the standard data_dir and path_coutwildrnp_shp fixtures (#616).\n- Root logger configuration has been removed from all test scripts (#615).\n- An AWS session is created for the CLI context Env only if explicitly\n  requested, matching the behavior of Rasterio's CLI (#635).\n- Dependency on attrs is made explicit.\n- Other dependencies are pinned to known good versions in requirements files.\n- Unused arguments have been removed from the Env constructor (#637).\n\nRefactoring:\n\n- A with_context_env decorator has been added and used to set up the GDAL\n  environment for CLI commands.

It will be removed in Fiona 2.0. Please check for\n  usage of this deprecated feature by running your tests or programs with\n  `PYTHONWARNINGS=\"always:::fiona\"` or `-W\"always:::fiona\"` and switch from\n  `next(collection)` to `next(iter(collection))` (#301).\n\nBug fix:\n\n- Zipped streams of bytes can be accessed by `BytesCollection` (#318).",

Fiona 1.7.1 doesn't add explicit support for\n  these types, they are coerced to geometry types 1-7 ('Point', 'LineString',\n  etc.)\n- Raise an `UnsupportedGeometryTypeError` when a bogus or unsupported \n  geometry type is encountered in a new collection's schema or elsewhere\n  (#340).\n- Enable `--precision 0` for fio-cat (#370).\n- Prevent datetime exceptions from unnecessarily stopping collection iteration\n  by yielding `None` (#385)\n- Replace log.warn calls with log.warning calls (#379).\n- Print an error message if neither gdal-config or `--gdalversion` indicate\n  a GDAL C API version when running `setup.py` (#364).\n- Let dict-like subclasses through CRS type checks (#367).\n\n1.7.0post2 (2016-06-15)\n-----------------------\n\nPackaging: define extension modules for 'clean' and 'config' targets (#363).\n\n1.7.0post1 (2016-06-15)\n-----------------------\n\nPackaging: No files are copied for the 'clean' setup target (#361, #362).\n\n1.7.0 (2016-06-14)\n------------------\n\nThe C extension modules in this library can now be built and used with either\na 1.x or 2.x release of the GDAL library. Big thanks to René Buffat for\nleading this effort.\n\nRefactoring:\n\n- The `ogrext1.pyx` and `ogrext2.pyx` files now use separate\n  C APIs defined in `ogrext1.pxd` and `ogrex2.pxd`. The other extension\n  modules have been refactored so that they do not depend on either of these\n  modules and use subsets of the GDAL/OGR API compatible with both GDAL 1.x and\n  2.x (#359).\n\nPackaging:\n\n- Source distributions now contain two different sources for the\n  `ogrext` extension module. The `ogrext1.c` file will be used with GDAL 1.x\n  and the `ogrext2.c` file will be used with GDAL 2.x.\n\n1.7b2 (2016-06-13)\n------------------\n\n- New feature: enhancement of the `--layer` option for fio-cat and fio-dump\n  to allow separate layers of one or more multi-layer input files to be\n  selected (#349).\n\n1.7b1 (2016-06-10)\n------------------\n\n- New feature: support for GDAL version 2+ (#259).\n- New feature: a new fio-calc CLI command (#273).\n- New feature: `--layer` options for fio-info (#316) and fio-load (#299).\n- New feature: a `--no-parse` option for fio-collect that lets a careful user\n  avoid extra JSON serialization and deserialization (#306).\n- Bug fix: `+wktext` is now preserved when serializing CRS from WKT to PROJ.4\n  dicts (#352).\n- Bug fix: a small memory leak when opening a collection has been fixed (#337).\n- Bug fix: internal unicode errors now result in a log message and a \n  `UnicodeError` exception, not a `TypeError` (#356).\n\n1.6.4 (2016-05-06)\n------------------\n- Raise ImportError if the active GDAL library version is >= 2.0 instead of\n  failing unpredictably (#338, #341). Support for GDAL>=2.0 is coming in\n  Fiona 1.7.\n\n1.6.3.post1 (2016-03-27)\n------------------------\n- No changes to the library in this post-release version, but there is a\n  significant change to the distributions on PyPI: to help make Fiona more\n  compatible with Shapely on OS X, the GDAL shared library included in the\n  macosx (only) binary wheels now statically links the GEOS library.

Fiona\n  now raises errors derived from UnicodeError when field names or field\n  values can't be encoded.\n\n1.6.2 (2015-09-22)\n------------------\n- Providing only PROJ4 representations in the dataset meta property resulted in\n  loss of CRS information when using the `fiona.open(..., **src.meta) as dst`\n  pattern (#265).

Pythons 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 now supported.\n\n0.12.1 (2013-04-16)\n-------------------\n- Fix messed up linking of README in sdist (#39).\n\n0.12 (2013-04-15)\n-----------------\n- Fix broken installation of extension modules (#35).\n- Log CPL errors at their matching Python log levels.\n- Use upper case for encoding names within OGR, lower case in Python.\n\n0.11 (2013-04-14)\n-----------------\n- Cythonize .pyx files (#34).\n- Work with or around OGR's internal recoding of record data (#35).\n- Fix bug in serialization of int/float PROJ.4 params.\n\n0.10 (2013-03-23)\n-----------------\n- Add function to get the width of str type properties.\n- Handle validation and schema representation of 3D geometry types (#29).\n- Return {'geometry': None} in the case of a NULL geometry (#31).\n\n0.9.1 (2013-03-07)\n------------------\n- Silence the logger in ogrext.so (can be overridden).\n- Allow user specification of record field encoding (like 'Windows-1252' for\n  Natural Earth shapefiles) to help when OGR can't detect it.\n\n0.9 (2013-03-06)\n----------------\n- Accessing file metadata (crs, schema, bounds) on never inspected closed files\n  returns None without exceptions.\n- Add a dict of supported_drivers and their supported modes.\n- Raise ValueError for unsupported drivers and modes.\n- Remove asserts from ogrext.pyx.\n- Add validate_record method to collections.\n- Add helpful coordinate system functions to fiona.crs.\n- Promote use of fiona.open over fiona.collection.\n- Handle Shapefile's mix of LineString/Polygon and multis (#18).\n- Allow users to specify width of shapefile text fields (#20).\n\n0.8 (2012-02-21)\n----------------\n- Replaced .opened attribute with .closed (product of collection() is always\n  opened). Also a __del__() which will close a Collection, but still not to be\n  depended upon.\n- Added writerecords method.\n- Added a record buffer and better counting of records in a collection.\n- Manage one iterator per collection/session.\n- Added a read-only bounds property.\n\n0.7 (2012-01-29)\n----------------\n- Initial timezone-naive support for date, time, and datetime fields. Don't use\n  these field types if you can avoid them. RFC 3339 datetimes in a string field\n  are much better.\n\n0.6.2 (2012-01-10)\n------------------\n- Diagnose and set the driver property of collection in read mode.\n- Fail if collection paths are not to files. Multi-collection workspaces are\n  a (maybe) TODO.\n\n0.6.1 (2012-01-06)\n------------------\n- Handle the case of undefined crs for disk collections.\n\n0.6 (2012-01-05)\n----------------\n- Support for collection coordinate reference systems based on Proj4.\n- Redirect OGR warnings and errors to the Fiona log.\n- Assert that pointers returned from the ograpi functions are not NULL before\n  using.\n\n0.5 (2011-12-19)\n----------------\n- Support for reading and writing collections of any geometry type.\n- Feature and Geometry classes replaced by mappings (dicts).\n- Removal of Workspace class.\n\n0.2 (2011-09-16)\n----------------\n- Rename WorldMill to Fiona.\n\n0.1.1 (2008-12-04)\n------------------\n- Support for features with no geometry.\n\nCredits\n=======",

  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to efficiently read and write spatial data files in various GIS formats, including GeoPackage and Shapefile. With fiona, developers can easily stream simple feature data from their applications and systems into these formats for use in geographic analysis or mapping projects."
