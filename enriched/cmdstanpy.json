It supports both development and production workflows. Because model development and testing may require many iterations, the defaults favor development mode and therefore output files are stored on a temporary filesystem. Non-default options allow all aspects of a run to be specified so that scripts can be used to distributed analysis jobs across nodes and machines.\n\nCmdStanPy is distributed via PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/cmdstanpy/\n\nor Conda Forge: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cmdstanpy\n\nGoals\n\n- Clean interface to Stan services so that CmdStanPy can keep up with Stan releases.\n\n- Provide access to all CmdStan inference methods.\n\n- Easy to install,\n  + minimal Python library dependencies: numpy, pandas\n  + Python code doesn't interface directly with c++, only calls compiled executables\n\n- Modular - CmdStanPy produces a MCMC sample (or point estimate) from the posterior; other packages do analysis and visualization.\n\n- Low memory overhead - by default, minimal memory used above that required by CmdStanPy; objects run CmdStan programs and track CmdStan input and output files.\n\nSource Repository\n\nCmdStanPy and CmdStan are available from GitHub: https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanpy and https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan\n\nDocs\n\nThe latest release documentation is hosted on  https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanpy, older release versions are available from readthedocs:  https://cmdstanpy.readthedocs.io\n\nLicensing\n\nThe CmdStanPy, CmdStan, and the core Stan C++ code are licensed under new BSD.\n\nExample",
