And many databases only support SQL, with no Python API. Ibis solves this problem by providing a common API for data manipulation in Python, and compiling that API into the backend’s native language. This means you can learn a single API and use it across any supported backend (execution engine).\n\nIbis broadly supports two types of backend:\n\n1. SQL-generating backends\n2. DataFrame-generating backends\n\nPortability\n\nTo use different backends, you can set the backend Ibis uses:\n\nTypically, you'll create a connection object:\n\nAnd work with tables in that backend:\n\nYou can also read from common file formats like CSV or Apache Parquet:\n\nThis allows you to iterate locally and deploy remotely by changing a single line of code.\n\n>  **Tip**\n>\n> Check out [the blog on backend agnostic arrays](https://ibis-project.org/posts/backend-agnostic-arrays/) for one example using the same code across DuckDB and BigQuery.\n\nCommunity and contributing\n\nIbis is an open source project and welcomes contributions from anyone in the community.\n\nJoin our community by interacting on GitHub or chatting with us on [Zulip](https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com/).\n\nFor more information visit https://ibis-project.org/.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe Ibis project is an [independently governed](https://github.com/ibis-project/governance/blob/main/governance.md) open source community project to build and maintain the portable Python dataframe library. Ibis has contributors across a range of data companies and institutions.",
