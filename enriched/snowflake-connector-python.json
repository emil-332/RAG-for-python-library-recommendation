      "text": "Release Notes\n- v4.1.1(TBD)\n  - Relaxed pandas dependency requirements for Python below 3.12.\n  - Changed CRL cache cleanup background task to daemon to avoid blocking main thread.\n  - Fixed NO_PROXY issues with PUT operations\n\n- v4.1.0(November 18,2025)\n  - Added the `SNOWFLAKE_AUTH_FORCE_SERVER` environment variable to force the use of the local-listening server when using the `externalbrowser` auth method.\n  - Fix compilation error when building from sources with libc++.\n  - Pin lower versions of dependencies to oldest version without vulnerabilities.\n  - Added no_proxy parameter for proxy configuration without using environmental variables.\n  - Added OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_CODE and OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS to list of authenticators that don't require user to be set\n  - Added `oauth_socket_uri` connection parameter allowing to separate server and redirect URIs for local OAuth server.\n  - Made platform_detection logs silent and improved its timeout handling. Added support for ENV_VAR_DISABLE_PLATFORM_DETECTION environment variable.\n  - Fixed FIPS environments md5 hash issues with multipart upload on Azure.\n\n- v4.0.0(October 09,2025)\n  - Added support for checking certificates revocation using revocation lists (CRLs)\n  - Added `CERT_REVOCATION_CHECK_MODE` to `CLIENT_ENVIRONMENT`\n  - Added the `workload_identity_impersonation_path` parameter to support service account impersonation for Workload Identity Federation on GCP and AWS workloads only\n  - Fixed `get_results_from_sfqid` when using `DictCursor` and executing multiple statements at once\n  - Added the `oauth_credentials_in_body` parameter supporting an option to send the oauth client credentials in the request body\n  - Fix retry behavior for `ECONNRESET` error\n  - Added an option to exclude `botocore` and `boto3` dependencies by setting `SNOWFLAKE_NO_BOTO` environment variable during installation\n  - Revert changing exception type in case of token expired scenario for `Oauth` authenticator back to `DatabaseError`\n  - Enhanced configuration file security checks with stricter permission validation.\n  - Fixed the return type of `SnowflakeConnection.cursor(cursor_class)` to match the type of `cursor_class`\n  - Constrained the types of `fetchone`, `fetchmany`, `fetchall`\n  - Fix \"No AWS region was found\" error if AWS region was set in `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` variable instead of `AWS_REGION` for `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY` authenticator\n  - Add `ocsp_root_certs_dict_lock_timeout` connection parameter to set the timeout (in seconds) for acquiring the lock on the OCSP root certs dictionary. Default value for this parameter is -1 which indicates no timeout.\n  - Fixed behaviour of trying S3 Transfer Accelerate endpoint by default for internal stages, and always getting HTTP403 due to permissions missing on purpose. Now /accelerate is not attempted.\n\n- v3.18.0(October 03,2025)\n  - Added support for pandas conversion for Day-time and Year-Month Interval types\n\n- v3.17.4(September 22,2025)\n  - Added support for intermediate certificates as roots when they are stored in the trust store\n  - Bumped up vendored `urllib3` to `2.5.0` and `requests` to `v2.32.5`\n  - Dropped support for OpenSSL versions older than 1.1.1\n\n- v3.17.3(September 02,2025)\n  - Enhanced configuration file permission warning messages.\n  - Fixed the bug with staging pandas dataframes on AWS - the regional endpoint is used when required\n\n- v3.17.2(August 23,2025)\n  - Fixed a bug where platform_detection was retrying failed requests with warnings to non-existent endpoints.\n  - Added disabling endpoint-based platform detection by setting `platform_detection_timeout_seconds` to zero.",

      "text": "- v3.17.1(August 17,2025)\n  - Added `infer_schema` parameter to `write_pandas` to perform schema inference on the passed data.\n  - Namespace `snowlake` reverted back to non-module.\n\n- v3.17.0(August 16,2025)\n  - Added in-band HTTP exception telemetry.\n  - Added an `unsafe_skip_file_permissions_check` flag to skip file permission checks on the cache and configuration.\n  - Added `APPLICATION_PATH` within `CLIENT_ENVIRONMENT` to distinguish between multiple scripts using the Python Connector in the same environment.\n  - Added basic JSON support for Interval types.\n  - Added in-band OCSP exception telemetry.\n  - Added support for new authentication methods with Workload Identity Federation (WIF).\n  - Added support for the `use_vectorized_scanner` parameter in the write_pandas function.\n  - Added support of proxy setup using connection parameters without emitting environment variables.\n  - Added populating of `type_code` in `ResultMetadata` for interval types.\n  - Introduced the `snowflake_version` property to the connection.\n  - Moved `OAUTH_TYPE` to `CLIENT_ENVIROMENT`.\n  - Relaxed the `pyarrow` version constrain; versions >= 19 can now be used.\n  - Disabled token caching for OAuth Client Credentials authentication.\n  - Fixed OAuth authenticator values.\n  - Fixed a bug where a PAT with an external session authenticator was used while `external_session_id` was not provided in `SnowflakeRestful.fetch`.\n  - Fixed the case-sensitivity of `Oauth` and `programmatic_access_token` authenticator values.\n  - Fixed unclear error messages for incorrect `authenticator` values.\n  - Fixed GCS staging by ensuring the endpoint has a scheme.\n  - Fixed a bug where time-zoned timestamps fetched as a `pandas.DataFrame` or `pyarrow.Table` would overflow due to unnecessary precision. A clear error will now be raised if an overflow cannot be prevented.\n\n- v3.16.0(July 04,2025)\n  - Bumped numpy dependency from =16.2.0,=22.0.0,=23.1.0,=23.1.0,=2.6.0,=2.6.0,=1.0.0,=1.0.0,=3.1.0 to >=3.1.0,=16.2.0,=16.2.0,=2.6.0,=2.6.0, ``manager`` renaming more consistent in ``snowflake.connector.config_manager`` module.\n  - Added support for default values for ConfigOptions\n  - Added default_connection_name to config.toml file\n\n- v3.1.1(August 28,2023)\n\n- Fixed a bug in retry logic for okta authentication to refresh token.\n  - Support `RSAPublicKey` when constructing `AuthByKeyPair` in addition to raw bytes.\n  - Fixed a bug when connecting through SOCKS5 proxy, the attribute `proxy_header` is missing on `SOCKSProxyManager`.\n  - Cherry-picked https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/fd2759aa16b12b33298900c77d29b3813c6582de onto vendored urllib3 (v1.26.15) to enable enforce_content_length by default.\n  - Fixed a bug in tag generation of OOB telemetry event.\n\n- v3.1.0(July 31,2023)\n\n- Added a feature that lets you add connection definitions to the `connections.toml` configuration file. A connection definition refers to a collection of connection parameters, for example, if you wanted to define a connection named `prod``:\n\n- Bumped cryptography dependency from =3.1.0 to >=3.1.0,=1.0.0 to >=1.0.0,=8.0.0,=10.0.1,1 to submit the specified exact number of statements in a multi-statement query\n\n- v2.8.3(November 28,2022)\n\n- Bumped cryptography dependency from =8.0.0,=16.2.0,=2.5 to >=2.5,=16.2.0 to >=16.2.0,=1.0.0 to >=1.0.0,=1.7,<1.8\n\n- v1.3.17 (June 1, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.16 (April 20, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.15 (March 30, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.14 (February 24, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.13 (February 9, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.12 (February 2, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.11 (January 27, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.10 (January 26, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.9 (January 16, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.8 (January 12, 2017)\n\n- v1.3.7 (December 8, 2016)\n\n- v1.3.6 (December 1, 2016)\n\n- v1.3.5 (November 17, 2016)\n\n- v1.3.4 (November 3, 2016)\n\n- v1.3.3 (October 20, 2016)",
