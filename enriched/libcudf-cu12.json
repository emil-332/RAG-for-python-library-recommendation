      "text": "&nbsp;cuDF - A GPU-accelerated DataFrame library for tabular data processing\n\ncuDF (pronounced \"KOO-dee-eff\") is an [Apache 2.0 licensed](LICENSE), GPU-accelerated DataFrame library\nfor tabular data processing. The cuDF library is one part of the [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) GPU\nAccelerated Data Science suite of libraries.\n\nAbout\n\ncuDF is composed of multiple libraries including:\n\n* [libcudf](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/libcudf_docs/): A CUDA C++ library with [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) compliant\ndata structures and fundamental algorithms for tabular data.\n* [pylibcudf](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/pylibcudf/): A Python library providing [Cython](https://cython.org/) bindings for libcudf.\n* [cudf](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/user_guide/): A Python library providing\n* [cudf-polars](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/cudf_polars/): A Python library providing a GPU engine for [Polars](https://pola.rs/)\n* [dask-cudf](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/dask-cudf/stable/): A Python library providing a GPU backend for [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) DataFrames\n\nNotable projects that use cuDF include:\n\n* [Spark RAPIDS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids): A GPU accelerator plugin for [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)\n* [Velox-cuDF](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox/blob/main/velox/experimental/cudf/README.md): A [Velox](https://velox-lib.io/)\nextension module to execute Velox plans on the GPU\n* [Sirius](https://www.sirius-db.com/): A GPU-native SQL engine providing extensions for libraries like [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)\n\nInstallation\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nOperating System, GPU driver, and supported CUDA version information can be found at the [RAPIDS Installation Guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/install/#system-req)\n\npip\n\nA stable release of each cudf library is available on PyPI. You will need to match the major version number of your installed CUDA version with a `-cu##` suffix when installing from PyPI.\n\nA development version of each library is available as a nightly release by including the `-i https://pypi.anaconda.org/rapidsai-wheels-nightly/simple` index.\n\nconda\n\nA stable release of each cudf library is available to be installed with the conda package manager by specifying the `-c rapidsai` channel.\n\nA development version of each library is available as a nightly release by specifying the `-c rapidsai-nightly` channel instead.\n\nsource\n\nTo install cuDF from source, please follow [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-your-build-environment) detailing\nhow to setup the build environment.\n\nExamples\n\nThe following examples showcase reading a parquet file, dropping missing rows with a null value,\nand performing a groupby aggregation on the data.\n\ncudf\n\n`import cudf` and the APIs are largely similar to pandas.\n\ncudf.pandas\n\nWith a Python file containing pandas code:\n\nUse cudf.pandas by invoking `python` with `-m cudf.pandas`\n\nIf running the pandas code in an interactive Jupyter environment, call `%load_ext cudf.pandas` before\nimporting pandas.\n\ncudf-polars\n\nUsing Polars' [lazy API](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/lazy/), call `collect` with `engine=\"gpu\"` to run\nthe operation on the GPU\n\nQuestions and Discussion\n\nFor bug reports or feature requests, please [file an issue](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/new/choose) on the GitHub issue tracker.\n\nFor questions or discussion about cuDF and GPU data processing, feel free to post in the [RAPIDS Slack](https://rapids.ai/slack-invite) workspace.\n\nContributing\n\ncuDF is open to contributions from the community! Please see our [guide for contributing to cuDF](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.",

  "usage_description": "Here is a 2-sentence summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library is used to accelerate tabular data processing on GPUs, enabling developers to efficiently perform complex data operations in parallel. With cuDF, developers can process large datasets up to 100x faster than traditional CPU-based approaches."
