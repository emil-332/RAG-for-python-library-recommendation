  "usage_description": "Here is a short (2-sentence) summary of what a developer can achieve with this library:\n\nThis library, PyTensor, is used to efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays on CPUs and GPUs. With its extensible graph framework and transpilation capabilities, developers can optimize complex computations and leverage the power of various backend technologies like C, JAX, and Numba."
