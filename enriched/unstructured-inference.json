The `get_model` function can be used to construct one of our out-of-the-box models from a keyword, e.g.:\n\nUsing your own model\n\nAny detection model can be used for in the `unstructured_inference` pipeline by wrapping the model in the `UnstructuredObjectDetectionModel` class. To integrate with the `DocumentLayout` class, a subclass of `UnstructuredObjectDetectionModel` must have a `predict` method that accepts a `PIL.Image.Image` and returns a list of `LayoutElement`s, and an `initialize` method, which loads the model and prepares it for inference.\n\nSecurity Policy\n\nSee our [security policy](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-inference/security/policy) for\ninformation on how to report security vulnerabilities.\n\nLearn more\n\nSection\n-\n[Unstructured Community Github](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community)\n[Unstructured Github](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO)\n[Company Website](https://unstructured.io)",
