This repository contains the core library.\n\n* `Website `_\n* `Documentation `_\n* `Slack `_\n* `Open Astronomy Discourse `_\n* `Astropy users mailing list `_\n* `Astropy developers mailing list `_\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install `astropy` from PyPI, use:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\nFor more detailed instructions, see the `install guide\n`_ in the docs.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nUser Stats\n\nThe Astropy Project is made both by and for its users, so we welcome and\nencourage contributions of many kinds. Our goal is to keep this a positive,\ninclusive, successful, and growing community that abides by the\n`Astropy Community Code of Conduct\n`_.\n\nFor guidance on contributing to or submitting feedback for the Astropy Project,\nsee the `contributions page `_.\nFor contributing code specifically, the developer docs have a\n`guide `_ with a quickstart.\nThere's also a `summary of contribution guidelines `_.\n\nDeveloping with Codespaces\n==========================\n\nGitHub Codespaces is a cloud development environment using Visual Studio Code\nin your browser. This is a convenient way to start developing Astropy, using\nour `dev container `_ configured\nwith the required packages. For help, see the `GitHub Codespaces\ndocs `_.\n\nCodespaces\n\nAcknowledging and Citing\n========================\nSee the `acknowledgement and citation guide\n`_ and the `CITATION\n`_ file.\n\nSupporting the Project\n======================\n\nNumFOCUS\n\nThe Astropy Project is sponsored by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the\nUnited States. You can donate to the project by using the link above, and this\ndonation will support our mission to promote sustainable, high-level code base\nfor the astronomy community, open code development, educational materials, and\nreproducible scientific research.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nAstropy is licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see the\n`LICENSE.rst `_ file.\n\n.. |Astropy Logo| image:: https://github.com/astropy/repo_stats/blob/main/dashboard_template/astropy_banner_gray.svg\n\n.. |User Stats| image:: https://github.com/astropy/repo_stats/blob/cache/cache/astropy_user_stats_light.png\n\n.. |CircleCI Status| image::  https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/astropy/astropy/main?logo=circleci&label=CircleCI\n\n.. |PyPI Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/astropy.svg\n\n.. |Supported Python Versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/astropy\n\n.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/astropy/latest.svg?logo=read%20the%20docs&logoColor=white&label=Docs&version=stable",
